                    <div class="author">Sebastian Torrelio</div>
                    <div class="bio">Torrelio was an A&E senior staffer from 2014-2015 and an A&E film & television editor from 2013-2014.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>I must namecheck one individual in particular who is responsible for my career at the Daily Bruin: a tall, buffoonish caricature of James Bond&apos;s dashing looks called Aren Alexander. <br><br>

Alexander, a former Daily Bruin photographer, was my second-year roommate who, knowing that I loved movies far too much, forced me to apply as an intern that fall quarter. He is to blame for my presence at this organization and all formal and informal complaints should be sent his way.<br><br>

He was correct, however, in acknowledging that one of my main goals in life has been to become a film critic. Over the last three years I have manipulated my way through this establishment to a position that allows me to write about practically any movie that I want, so I would say I&apos;ve succeeded. Why anyone has permitted me to keep this much power for this long is beyond reason.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll summarize my tyrannical bumbling through the Daily Bruin&apos;s Arts &amp; Entertainment section with a few brief memories. Initially, I had joined the paper under the reign of editor in chief James Barragan, a man whose overbearing charm has always subtly reminded me of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of fertility.
<br><br>
During my first year at the Daily Bruin, I started a nonsensical column titled &quot;Love|Hate,&quot; in which I and another A&amp;E writer (professional bearer of bad opinions Tony Huang) would speak briefly about entertainment topics we saw trending on Twitter that week. It grew very popular.<br><br>

At one point during a budget meeting, Barragan complimented my &quot;Love|Hate&quot; column for that week, which discussed the Marvel cinematic franchise. Barragan complimented me because I spoke highly of Iron Man, and he thought Iron Man was cool or something. It was the highlight of my Daily Bruin career.<br><br>

The following year, I applied to be a film &amp; television editor under the rule of Jillian Beck, a commanding woman who was very consistent in reminding her staffers that she loved the Boston Red Sox more than she loved any of them, not that anyone could blame her.<br><br>

The most intimate interaction I had with Beck while working as an editor occurred while I was writing a movie review, and she had noticed I mistakenly submitted the word &quot;twat&quot; when I meant to say &quot;twit.&quot; This error also describes my experience as a film editor pretty effectively.<br><br>

I spent much of my role as editor not editing for days at a time. It culminated in the week that I covered the American Film Institute festival, leaving my school, friends and job for eight straight days to watch foreign movies in Hollywood. The festival was a wonderful learning experience that I vigorously wrote about for A&amp;E&apos;s online blog Spotlight and, as such, my writings were never read by the general public.<br><br>

It is worth noting that after my stint as editor, my work with the Daily Bruin led to a summer editorial internship at Variety magazine. At Variety, I reported for the weekly print magazine, covered premiere events, conducted interviews with famous personalities, ate ice cream with J.K. Simmons, had smoke blown in my face by Leonardo DiCaprio and spent a night in a small hotel smoke room with Kid Cudi and his posse. The job had its highs and lows.<br><br>

This brings me to the past year, under editor in chief Andrew Erickson, a man who perfectly embodies what I believe Huey Lewis to have been like in his college years. I make daily rituals out of perpetually bothering everyone who comes in through the front entrance to our office and occasional games out of who I can bother most. I&apos;m suspicious as to why I haven&apos;t been fired yet.<br><br>

Being my last year, I have come to an interesting realization, though. There is no one at the Daily Bruin who I truly consider to be a long-time friend. I have made plenty of good friends, and have hung out, partied or otherwise had positive relationships with practically everyone on the main staff for my past three years at the paper.<br><br>

Yet I don&apos;t know if I will see a lot, if any, of the people that I have met at this organization again after I graduate. Perhaps that speaks to my own character, or the character of the people that I have worked with.<br><br>

I do hope I see some of them again, even if it must take some unrealized personal effort. I recognize now, almost three years after the fact, that joining the Daily Bruin purely to become a film critic was a hollow goal. At the very least, it&apos;s a hollow goal that I took the time to fulfill.<br><br>

                    <p>It was 9:05 p.m. in San Jose. I was at the 2013 California College Media Association awards with the editor in chief and the campus News editor. The Daily Bruin had just won 24 awards, and I was busy doodling a picture of my harp on the event&apos;s program.
<br><br>
This was emblematic of my past four years &ndash; always being in two places at once.
<br><br>
My second year at UCLA, I auditioned for the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music&apos;s ethnomusicology program and got in. My lifelong dream of becoming a musician was finally realized and coming true. I held that dream proudly in my hands and vowed to never let anything get in the way.
<br><br>
But like all dreams in Los Angeles, one wasn&apos;t enough.
<br><br>
In my third year, I became the broadcast producer for The Bruin&apos;s Radio department. I thought, &quot;I&apos;m tired of getting these uncertain looks when I tell people I&apos;m studying music. I need something more. I enjoy journalism and care about people. So, there&apos;s that.&quot;
<br><br>
Here at The Bruin, I watched people trade in extra hours of sleep for extra shots of espresso. I witnessed editors master the art of typing on the computer with one hand, tweeting an update with the other, all while talking on the phone, which would be crunched uncomfortably between their head and shoulder.
<br><br>
And after watching these ridiculous balancing acts day after day, I began to realize how unhappy I was.
<br><br>
Because I was jealous.
<br><br>
I was jealous to see these people go above and beyond for what they love to do &ndash; to get that voice heard, to get that story told. Meanwhile my true love, the harp, remained untouched in the basement of Schoenberg Music Building, as I stayed in a windowless office, editing a radio show that probably only 10 people had listened to that week.
<br><br>
I broke my vow to music for something I liked, but did not love.
<br><br>
And now I was thinking, I spent four years here and this may not be something I want to do. Was it a waste of time? Was The Bruin&apos;s name on my resume and the decent paycheck that paid the groceries worth it?
<br><br>
No.
<br><br>
But my friends were.
<br><br>
You see, I was missing the point. I had been caught up worrying too much about how I didn&apos;t spend my time, rather than how I did spend my time.
<br><br>
This was, and continues to be, a small but significant lesson I learn over and over again. I&apos;m an introvert, who relies on self-manufactured happiness, who enjoys being alone, and who has difficulty accepting love from others. Always living in the &quot;what-ifs&quot; and the &quot;what-can-be-done-nexts.&quot;
<br><br>
But the people here taught me that life is more than moments waiting to be checked off a list. They&apos;re moments waiting to be shared with others.
<br><br>
These were mine.
<br><br>
I remember when I was going through a tough time with my housing situation and couch-hopped for two weeks. One afternoon, I found myself crashed at the Radio desk, only to wake up to a care package filled with several boxes of soup, Cheerios and a note saying, &quot;I&apos;m here for you.&quot;
<br><br>
I remember when my grandpa passed away, and I quietly and strategically ran to the stairwell to cry in solitude. Minutes later, I felt someone sit next to me. It was a staffer who had noticed I left the office, and before I could say a word, gave me a hug.
<br><br>
I remember climbing rocks in the desert with another staffer and talking about our love for Jesus. We eventually created a Bible study within the Daily Bruin for Christians and those interested in Christianity. We called ourselves &quot;DB Community Group&quot; because that&apos;s what it was: a community.
<br><br>
I remember laughing with friends over our weekly &quot;ice cream Mondays.&quot;
<br><br>
I don&apos;t have to be in two places at once to be successful, I don&apos;t need to be successful to be happy, and I don&apos;t need to be happy to be grateful. My friends helped me find the courage to recognize what I had in the moment, so I could finally tell myself, &quot;This is enough.&quot;
<br><br>
My friends were, are and will always be enough. I am grateful for each one of you.
<br><br>
I quit wrongly penalizing staffers in my head for loving The Bruin, I quit whining that I didn&apos;t make enough time for music, and I quit being hard on myself for thinking the best way to spend time was to do everything my way.
<br><br>
I didn&apos;t fall in love with The Bruin, and that&apos;s okay. This isn&apos;t my love story.
<br><br>
It&apos;s my thank-you note.
<br><br>
My dear friends &ndash; and you all know who you are &ndash; thank you for helping me realize that time spent in friendship is time well spent.<br/>

                    <p>Outside the Daily Bruin&apos;s editor in chief office hangs a black board encased within a plastic cover.
<br><br>
During my junior year as an assistant Sports editor, our editor in chief left two words scribbled in aqua blue up on the board:
<br><br>
Be bold.
<br><br>
I walked by that sign multiple times a day on my way into and out of the office that year.
<br><br>
From time to time, I&apos;d read it over.
<br><br>
Once in a while, maybe after a long day&apos;s work, I&apos;d knowingly place my hand on the case as I left the office.
<br><br>
Most times, though, I wouldn&apos;t even notice it.
<br><br>
But the words were always there, somewhere in my mind: Be bold.
<br><br>
That&apos;s what I wanted our Sports section to be.
<br><br>
That&apos;s how I wanted our writers to practice journalism.
<br><br>
And that&apos;s who I wanted to be.
<br><br>
Sometimes those words took another, more-vocal form: Go big.
<br><br>
Either way, the concept was the same.
<br><br>
That year, my fellow Sports editors and I tried things that had never been done before in the section, or at least hadn&apos;t been in a very long time.
<br><br>
We did full-page previews for football games, dubbing them &apos;Football Fridays.&apos;
<br><br>
We fought for and printed far more six-column, page-spanning stories than in previous years.
<br><br>
We even printed a one-story section front in a regular issue.
<br><br>
We pushed out four feature series in 11 weeks, more than in the entire section&apos;s previous four-year total.
<br><br>
We sent our writers out to conduct the newly-innovated idea of &quot;15-minute interviews,&quot; where they would casually talk to athletes, putting the onus on our writers to face uncertainty and steer the ship themselves.
<br><br>
The list goes on and on.
<br><br>
Some of the projects we did became the talk of the office.
<br><br>
Some of our ideas we innovated admired.
<br><br>
But not all of the things we did when we stepped out of line worked.
<br><br>
Some of them went pretty awry.
<br><br>
Maybe a series was forced.
<br><br>
Perhaps a once well-thought plan punctured.
<br><br>
Potentially, a writer became disappointed with us along the way.
<br><br>
But whether we were on the right or wrong side of the line was beside the point.
<br><br>
What mattered was the courage to step out of line.
<br><br>
To push the limits.
<br><br>
To say, &apos;Let&apos;s go big,&apos; and to hope it would work but not know, and to be okay with that.
<br><br>
That&apos;s the message I want to leave behind at the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
And it&apos;s the same message I want to embody going forward.
<br><br>
As a newly turned 22-year-old and soon-to-be college graduate, I have a lot of doubts and uncertainty about this thing called &quot;the rest of my life.&quot;
<br><br>
But one thing I know I have hammered out: Be bold.
<br><br>
Oh, and as for how our tale as Sports editors and a paper ended that year.
<br><br>
The Daily Bruin&apos;s 2013-2014 staff went on to win an Associated Press Pacemaker award for best college newspaper in the country.
<br><br>
Our Sports section went on to win the staff-voted award for &apos;Best Section.&apos;
<br><br>
But from that I learned endings sometimes aren&apos;t as important as the way you get there.<br/>

                    <p>I dread the emptiness of a blank white page and the impatience of a blinking cursor.
<br><br>
To confront that blankness, armed with nothing but a pen or a keyboard, a mind and maybe an idea, is intimidating.
<br><br>
And yet, it is something journalists and writers do constantly. They conquer the cursor, tell stories, weave data together and lay bare what was hidden or obscured.
<br><br>
For me, a blank page is a mirror. Every time I choose to fill this space, I imprint a piece of myself onto the world. I may not know what that imprint will look like before I start writing, and I know that the first draft is never the last. Yet each draft and revision gets me closer to representing who I am.
<br><br>
As an Opinion columnist at the Daily Bruin, I strove to fill these pages with the most honest reflection of myself I could muster. In some of my favorite pieces I laid myself bare &ndash; I wrote about my culture, my inner conflicts and my politics. I often started writing before I knew where it would lead me. In this way, the Daily Bruin allowed me to discover and solidify pieces of myself that I did not recognize or understand before.
<br><br>
Writing became my refuge. When grappling with difficult topics like Israel-Palestine, local government or campus climate while also navigating the personal challenges of college, it sometimes felt like everything around me was unstable and crumbling. But I could always anchor myself in words.
<br><br>
Journalism allowed me to lay bare other people&apos;s stories as well. I interviewed professors, students, administrators and government representatives who at their core were researchers, refugees, activists, allies and experts. I can only hope that individuals like these will continue to grant me the privilege of reporting their stories with the compassion and accuracy that they deserve.
<br><br>
Whether telling our own truths, or reporting on someone else&apos;s, writing is both a responsibility and an experiment. We learn to accept the beautiful tension between a proud final draft and the knowledge that it is never really finished. There is always something left unsaid, something worded incorrectly, something that sounds a bit clich&eacute;d.
<br><br>
As we prepare to graduate from UCLA, we live and breathe this tension. Every year is a blank page. Every day a blinking cursor. Every past and future class, test, relationship and job is a perpetual rough draft, with each one revealing something about who we are and imprinting it onto the world.
<br><br>
Thank you to the editors, critics and avid readers who make each blank page worth filling over and over again. And thank you to my mentors, friends and family, whose constant love and support has imprinted itself onto me.
<br><br>
It is now time to close this document &ndash; until the next draft.<br/>

                    <p>Over the course of three years, I have oftentimes found myself looking down at my phone at a particular set of words: &quot;Hey Jose, can you take a shoot?&quot; Despite the fact that I had received the same message time and time again, from multiple editors, it never failed to evoke the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as I put the phone down. After a few minutes of frantically running through my mental schedule, I&apos;d type up the usual response, &quot;Hey, sorry I&apos;m busy today,&quot; and not even pay it a second thought. 
<br><br>
Now, if you&apos;re like me, when you get to the end of a great read, there&apos;s always that little part of you that doesn&apos;t want to turn the page because you realize that once you do, that&apos;s it. The story ends and the words that captivated you the entire time slowly fade away, out of sight and out of mind. As my time as a Bruin slowly ticks down, I find myself constantly hoping that I don&apos;t have to turn the page, not on the time that I have left here at UCLA, but on the time left that I have with the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
You see, as three years of being a photographer for the Daily Bruin wrap up, I&apos;ve come to realize just how incredible the office really is.
<br><br>
From coming together to create incredible coverage of the LGBT community in Malawi to frantically responding to the Sunset Boulevard water main break that unfortunately graced our campus, I have never seen an office so full of individuals with a burning passion for journalism. Even when the Daily Bruin&apos;s independence was challenged last year, the cramped space that many generations before us have come to love was resilient and held firm.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve seen three years worth of editors in chief, top and assistant editors and countless contributors come and go. During each of these years, I&apos;ve seen lifelong friendships form, incredible job opportunities obtained and even a relationship or two come to fruition.
<br><br>
On the verge of commencement, the thought of walking through the front door of Kerckhoff Hall into the office for one of the last times makes me regret many things. I didn&apos;t take enough shoots. I should have made a bigger effort. Why did I not push myself as I saw so many other photogs do?
<br><br>
As this last worry comes to mind, I always find a way to stop myself. I think back to the excitement I felt when I was first training as a contributor. I think about the incredibly talented individuals that I&apos;ve met along the way, some of whom have gone on to shoot for Sports Illustrated, USA Today Sports and Getty Images. I think about the never-ending laughs, meme creations and stressed looks on editors&apos; faces and realize that I could not be any more grateful to have been a part of the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
People often worry because their plans go astray, and life doesn&apos;t work in their favor. Yet, what many fail to realize is that when you step onto this campus and feel the nostalgia wash over you as you stroll past your usual hangout spots, you&apos;ll realize that it was every event along the way to graduation that truly defined your four-year undergraduate journey.
<br><br>
My undergraduate journey was full of many events and much debauchery, but the Daily Bruin was always there. While I&apos;m still a long way off from my ultimate goal &ndash; medical school &ndash; being a Daily Bruin photographer has reinforced the wisdom my dad imparts to me every time I&apos;m about to start a new journey: La paciencia es un don.
<br><br>
Spanish for &quot;Patience is a virtue.&quot;

I didn&apos;t think it would be hard to write this column. 
<br><br>

Maybe that&apos;s odd. Writing something that accurately captures what I&apos;ve learned during my time writing for the Daily Bruin &ndash; that explains what it feels like to be here, right now, standing with one foot inside Kerckhoff 118 and the other out &ndash; probably should never have seemed easy.
<br><br>
But I thought it would be easy because it called for me to do the thing every opinion columnist worth her salt loves to do the most: talk about myself.
<br><br>
What have I learned? What has the paper meant to me? What advice can I impart?
<br><br>
My second-year self imagined what would strike me now as a dramatic soliloquy. Dramatic and entirely unjustified.
<br><br>
I don&apos;t know much. I&apos;m young, and the future rambles out in front of me every day in a new direction. I am balancing on a precipice, I am holding my breath.
<br><br>
In this half-paralyzed state of fear and wonder, sitting in a drafty old apartment in the dark a few days before I walk across a stage and leave the newsroom for good, I only really want to say this: The only things of value I have ever done at the Daily Bruin (or will ever do anywhere) have nothing at all to do with me.
<br><br>
If there&apos;s anything I&apos;ve learned writing about other people for the last three years, it&apos;s that I matter a lot less than I thought I did.
<br><br>
That might seem obvious or clich&eacute;d, but this knowledge is the most beautiful gift the Daily Bruin has given me.
<br><br>
I did not start out a journalist &ndash; I started out someone who liked to write, who liked to see my byline, who did this work because of what it might say about me.
<br><br>
That is an ugly truth to acknowledge. Other people might read that and think I&apos;m shitty &ndash; I would have two years ago.
<br><br>
But the truth is that I&apos;m not shitty&#x3B; I&apos;m normal. I am a self-focused person as we all are, and I worked really hard and wrote really well because I wanted to be impressive. There is a particular proclivity among writers, I think, to want to clamber up the world&apos;s tallest ladder and shout into a megaphone for everyone to hear: I am here! I am important! Look at me!
<br><br>
I did not know it and never would have said it at the time, but when I first started working here, that&apos;s what I was doing: shouting into a megaphone.
<br><br>
The most important thing I&apos;ve learned through my time here is that this struggle for selflessness and graciousness in the work that you do doesn&apos;t really end. Every time I write a story I have to consider who has the megaphone: Is it someone else&apos;s voice I&apos;m interested in amplifying here, or my own?
<br><br>
I am grateful to this institution for a lot of things, but mostly for humbling me greatly. I hope to keep that humility with me wherever I go, whether I&apos;m writing or not, for the rest of my life.

The best advice I received this year came from a high school senior.
<br><br>
Toward the end of a high school journalism club meeting, as the students were putting the finishing touches on the Weekly Cobra layout, we talked about the uncertain future of journalism and my uncertain future within that uncertain future.
<br><br>
&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how you get past the wall,&quot; said the newsletter&apos;s then-editor Victor, attributing his wisdom to a recent assembly speaker. &quot;Go through it, over it, under it &ndash; just as long as you get past it.&quot;
<br><br>
I found that line oddly comforting, not just for myself, but for the institution I leave behind after four years on staff.
<br><br>
I don&apos;t know what the college newspaper landscape will look like in five years. I&apos;m not naive about that outlook, but I do believe there will always be a place in student media for hardworking, thoughtful people.
<br><br>
If I know one thing, it&apos;s that people will continue to run through walls for the Daily Bruin. I&apos;ve seen it too many times to think otherwise.
<br><br>
Our staffers are the ones who rose to the occasion when we were understaffed and struggling to make deadline in fall quarter. They were the ones who rolled up their sleeves this year when there were inserts and special projects to assemble. And they were the ones who rolled up their pant legs and reported when this campus was underwater in late July. They say there&apos;s supposed to be a transition period in taking over The Bruin, but our incoming editor in chief and managing editor have already gotten their feet wet.
<br><br>
They&apos;re the ones who put up with my horrible puns, like the one you just read.
<br><br>
They&apos;re the ones who made the Daily Bruin a home for me. It&apos;s a home I leave with a receding hairline and a few wrinkles, but with memories that make them worth it.
<br><br>
I started my journey at UCLA as a nervous women&apos;s water polo reporter. I end it nervous that I&apos;ll forget some of the incredible places this paper has allowed me to go.
<br><br>
Places like Myles Jack&apos;s living room, where Tim Bradbury and I finished up an interview and then drove into Seattle excitedly singing Katy Perry. I&apos;m sorry, Tim.
<br><br>
Places like Memphis&apos; FedExForum, where Kevin Bowman and I took barbecue recommendations from Tony Parker before covering the Sweet 16. You&apos;re right, Tony, Central was delicious.
<br><br>
Places like the press box of Memorial Stadium, where I watched Nebraska&apos;s student section &ndash; the Big Red faithful &ndash; release blue and gold balloons to remember Nick Pasquale. I still get chills thinking about that.
<br><br>
This year, I&apos;ve seen things from a different perspective, hunched over my desk in Kerckhoff 118 in the rickety wooden editor&apos;s chair.
<br><br>
It&apos;s a view I&apos;ve grown fond of, but really, Sam Hoff, I&apos;d consider replacing that chair.
<br><br>
I often tell people I don&apos;t think I will have a job more interesting than this one. That&apos;s not meant to be sad, but more the result of a fast-paced and ever-changing college newsroom environment.
<br><br>
That feeling is a reflection of the people I&apos;ve met and worked with. It&apos;s a reflection of the people who have shared their stories within our pages and especially the people who have emailed, called and visited to voice their opinions on our work, often to disagree.
<br><br>
I have so appreciated the opportunity to spend a year at the helm of this newsroom and four in UCLA&apos;s newsstands.
<br><br>
The Daily Bruin has launched me over the wall. Now I&apos;m going, going, gone.

                    <p>Some people live in the same house, on the same street, in the same town for most of their lives before they pack up and leave for college. 
<br><br>
Not me.
<br><br>
I was already living on my own in an apartment in San Diego &ndash; my 13th home &ndash; three days after graduating high school. Growing up in a Marine Corps family, moving became a normal part of my life.
<br><br>
The next four years at UCLA were no different. I lived in two dorm rooms, two apartments, two houses and a few hotel rooms along the way.
<br><br>
But during all that time of moving around, one place always felt like a real home: the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
In the windowless office filled with yellowing newspapers, I learned home is not a house or even a place.
<br><br>
It&apos;s a feeling.
<br><br>
Home is the support I feel when I walk into a room and see my family &ndash; the people who embrace me even on my worst days.
<br><br>
And let me tell you &ndash; there were some bad days. Stories fell through, and people threatened to sue. But no matter what, my Daily Bruin family was always there to help me through it.
<br><br>
Home is the pride I feel when I see people I care about succeeding.
<br><br>
As an editor, that was seeing my writers go from hesitant interns to confident reporters who wrote stories they were proud of. It was watching my closest friends create incredible journalism. The Daily Bruin staff is full of people who impress me and inspire me every day.
<br><br>
Home is coming into the office to write stories and knowing, more than anything else, this is what I should be doing.

Just weeks after starting at The Bruin, I no longer felt like the &quot;new kid,&quot; which was a feeling I carried for most of my life. I found my best friends at The Bruin. I found my passion in journalism. I found my sense of self.
<br><br>
I found my home.

                    <p>I fell in love with photography in a high school darkroom.
<br><br>
More specifically, I fell in love with the process. The flow of dipping prints from one chemical into another to the constant beat of a ticking clock was mesmerizing.
<br><br>
For a high school senior with few real outlets for creativity, I found myself captivated by the satisfaction of creating art with my hands.
<br><br>
So when I came to UCLA &ndash; thousands of miles from home to study computer science, I immediately searched for a place to practice my photography. It took two quarters of bouncing between clubs before I found myself in a photojournalism internship at the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
I quickly threw myself into my work, seeking the same satisfaction I found in the darkroom. The Bruin of course no longer uses film photography, and I instead started practicing digital photography.
<br><br>
The switch was almost instantaneous, and I quickly fell for photojournalism and the job of capturing moments and people. Though inexperienced and mostly a nuisance to my editors, I took shoot after shoot to hone my skills.
<br><br>
Along the way, I avoided my computer science studies because they didn&apos;t inspire the same passion that photojournalism did.
<br><br>
It didn&apos;t help that every tough moment in my college career &ndash; from ending a long-term relationship to struggling with school &ndash; was followed by more time spent at The Bruin.
<br><br>
By my third year, I was hopelessly in love with journalism. I trained in multiple sections to produce different types of journalistic content. I stuck my head in meetings that I had nothing to do with to hear and contribute ideas.
<br><br>
And as years passed and life after college came closer, I felt torn between computer science and journalism.
<br><br>
But then &ndash; this year, in fact &ndash; things worked out.
<br><br>
I directed my love for journalism toward a specific focus: online journalism. And even though I am not pursuing online journalism right after college, practicing it has helped me find satisfaction in creating with code.
<br><br>
The Bruin once had a darkroom in the center of the office, but it was replaced with a computer server room during the transition into the digital age.
<br><br>
It seems that now, a decade and a half later, my mind has transitioned the same way.

                    <p>
                        I&apos;ve never liked reading newspapers.
<br><br>
I find them uncomfortably large when opened, and I&apos;ve never been able to turn their pages without them trying to fall all over the place.
<br><br>
They&apos;re supposed to be effective conduits of important information but have the navigation scheme of a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; novel. I start at the beginning, get cut off, have to jump to the middle of a random page to get to an ending and then I have to start over.
<br><br>
It&apos;s frustrating because I like information. I like good writing and good journalism. I like knowing what&apos;s going on in the world around me. The revenue from the print product still pays the bills, but it has always seemed to me a poor medium for what it&apos;s supposed to do.
<br><br>
So I joined the Daily Bruin&apos;s Online department as a programmer to help improve its website. On the internet, I like the newspaper a lot better. The content fits comfortably on a phone screen, the navigation is coherent and articles can be searched for and saved without the physical overhead. Compelling stories can be enhanced with or told exclusively through audio and video.
<br><br>
However, I&apos;ve since learned there&apos;s something valuable about having to make something people can touch, though the benefit isn&apos;t necessarily for the readers. The pressure to fill a physical space that would otherwise be conspicuously blank creates a sense of urgency and purpose. Writers, editors, graphic designers, page designers, photographers, illustrators and copy editors have to work together to ship a product on a daily basis. It creates a stupid amount of stress for everyone involved. But having to work parallel to those kinds of pressures gives us as programmers content to work with and projects with deadlines.
<br><br>
As a result, the Daily Bruin&apos;s Online department has become an unlikely incubator and home for talented developers. We&apos;ve had people on our staff become interns at Facebook, Yahoo and Tumblr. This summer we have contributors that will be working at Microsoft, Adobe, Hulu, Disney, Bloomberg, Ernst and Young and startups in New York. We have graduating seniors that will be taking full time jobs at Google, Amazon, JPMorgan and IBM.
<br><br>
Most impressive of all to me is the young woman who came in here with no programming experience at all, and after less than a year she has an internship that will lead to a full-time web developer position after she graduates this spring.
<br><br>
The people here are talented and hardworking and would have been successful anywhere, so I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to work with them. It has been a rewarding experience to see people learn, collaborate and grow as they create visually stunning pages and cool interactive features. I&apos;m excited to see what the people here do next.
<br><br>
So while the Daily Bruin produces a physical paper that I find outmoded, it produces people that I find remarkable.

                    <div class="bio">Taketa was managing editor from 2014-2015, an assistant News editor from 2013-2014 and a News writer from 2012-2013.</div>

                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>I never believed I was meant to be a journalist.
<br><br>
I am 5 feet 2 inches tall and hardly have a commanding figure. I spent 12 years in Catholic school and was often taught to be kind but somewhat deferential to others. It wasn&apos;t easy for the 17-year-old, shy and awkward girl I was &ndash; the girl who abhorred public speaking, the girl who was too shy to dress up unless forced to do so &ndash; to become a journalist, somebody who cannot be limited by comfort zones or hesitations.
<br><br>
But the further I advance in this career, the more hours I spend reading the news or walking among passersby in the streets of Los Angeles, the more I know I have to be one.
<br><br>
I tell myself I must tell the stories of others because I am not confident in my own; even writing this column makes me uneasy, because I do not trust my own experiences are worthy of being told. It is because there&apos;s always someone out there who has lived more fully, someone who has taken the mundane and most tragic parts of human life and endured them with grace and unassuming resilience.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve met some of them in the stories I&apos;ve written &ndash; from a veteran with a wife and five children who came back to finish his UCLA degree after almost three decades, to a mother who struggled with how to teach her 6-year-old daughter about cancer and what it was doing to her small body and blond hair.
<br><br>
But I also see many of them just walking around the city or near UCLA &ndash; like the people who drive the bus in the morning, or the people who prepare our food or the people with cardboard signs on Third Street Promenade who watch shoppers with sunglasses and large bags pass them by.
<br><br>
From time to time, try asking yourself the questions a journalist would ask. Where are they from? How did they get here? What can they teach you?
<br><br>
Do we ask ourselves these questions enough in the midst of our everyday routines, when we return home from work in the evening or before we go out on a Thursday night? Do we try hard enough to find the answers?
<br><br>
Our job as journalists is to make sure such people with stories worth telling do not pass through history unnoticed. I cannot walk in their shoes just yet, but for now, this job will do.

                    <p>I recently joined a group of Daily Bruin staffers on a 3 a.m. trek to the outskirts of Los Angeles County to see our paper get printed. 
<br><br>
It felt like stepping back in time. It was also deafeningly loud and had a lingering, unidentifiable stench &ndash; but that&apos;s besides the point.
<br><br>
Ancient machines heaved blank sheets through colored plates and rotating gears to churn out our beloved paper. For the moment, we got to pretend we were in the golden era of newspapers &ndash; a time when people relied on the printed page rather than their computer screens.
<br><br>
Working at The Bruin is also a bit like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by archives of pictures, stories and columns that document not just the history of UCLA, but the paper itself. Inside jokes taped to the walls years ago and later forgotten. Clippings from old stories that someone was once proud of. A quote by an editor from generations past who no one has met, but everyone knows.
<br><br>
Like the rest of that golden newspaper era, The Bruin I know will soon fade into history.
<br><br>
My class graduates straddling the line between that old world of newsprint on our hands and the new world of online innovation. It is an exciting time with new and better-smelling possibilities.
<br><br>
For now, though, it is comforting to get lost in yesterday (I majored in history, so a penchant for nostalgia comes with the territory).
<br><br>
As I write this column, with commencement tickets on the table and my graduation gown hanging on the wall, I find myself clinging to the past more than ever.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to football games and midnight yells.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to the rooftop sunsets and tunneling adventures.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to the strangers I found in my hall freshman year who now are my family.
<br><br>
But most of all, I&apos;m clinging to the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
The future of journalism is murky. And, like many graduates, so is mine. For the first time in my life, I don&apos;t know the next step.
<br><br>
I do know that no matter what happens next, I will never really let go.

                    <p>I tend to know what I want from the get-go.
<br><br>
I already knew that an urban jungle was not my ideal choice of residence. I am not a city girl at heart. I wanted to go to a fantastical location that was remote, where it rained often and I could set up camp and be in complete solitude anytime I wanted. I had always lived on the eastern side of the City of Angels, and I wanted to leave that landscape behind.
<br><br>
I had high expectations for college. It had to be perfect from the start, because otherwise it felt like a failure that I could not justify. But eventually I understood that UCLA was not a place where everything magically fell into place, and that life continues in a similar fashion with manic highs and lows.
<br><br>
Somehow I got lucky eventually and found something here that made the initial doubt of my choices fade.
<br><br>
I never really used a camera before the Daily Bruin. A friend of mine had encouraged me to apply, and I did because of her. I was eventually accepted. Flash forward to now and to the fact that these columns cannot exceed a mini-novel, and I can now say that I know exactly what I want to do. I fell in love with photojournalism once I gave it my all. I was able to create beautiful memories by simply recording my observations through photographs. The act is more than enough for me to honestly say that I never regretted the decision I made four years ago. I am bound by no fear when I am behind the lens.
<br><br>
Being at this university for the past four years has been a safe haven for me, allowing me to move on from situations I had no previous control over. It may not have been everything that I had wanted it to be, but it was actually everything that I needed it to be. UCLA is imperfect, but it can give you much more than what you had before.

                    <p>I tried my best not to run up the steps of Kerckhoff Hall. I approached the foyer of Kerckhoff 118 gingerly. I knew that the prognosis was not good. Much to my surprise, I found my name after staring at the list of accepted photojournalism interns for the better part of two minutes. It was too good to be true. This must have been a typo.
<br><br>
It took four years to come around to accept that perhaps it wasn&apos;t just a typo that put me on that list. It was the fact that my editors believed in that nervous, overenthusiastic bundle of nerves that was me on my interview day. At least I&apos;m guessing it was that, since my portfolio at the time consisted of photos of flowers and my pets.
<br><br>
The most important thing I will take away from the windowless (and for a period of time, carpetless) office is what my four years at The Bruin taught me. The Daily Bruin has always been somewhere I found people who believed in me and people who believed in something better than themselves.
<br><br>
I almost didn&apos;t apply to the Daily Bruin because I was sure I wouldn&apos;t make it. I barely had down the basics of photography, and I most certainly didn&apos;t believe I&apos;d find my niche in that whirring office where everyone knew so much and seemed so in place. Looking back at my cringe-worthy application, that less-experienced, better-rested and utterly clueless version of myself doubted that I would ever make it this far. But that&apos;s what the Daily Bruin does. It brings out the best of you.
<br><br>
After I learned a few lessons about photography, such as how to hold a camera properly, how to turn a poster board into a reflector and how to create a studio for tacos in the trunk of a car, I found myself turning in my assistant Photo editor application for a second time. It took everything I had to go through the process again, with the possibility of a second rejection. Except I remembered I almost didn't apply to The Bruin in the first place, and that would have been the biggest mistake of my college career. So naturally, knowing I wasn&apos;t the strongest candidate and I did not know much about Photoshop, I expected the call I received the following week. It started, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry ...&quot; The second half of that sentence, however, was an unexpected &quot;... that you&apos;re an assistant editor next year.&quot;
<br><br>
Over the next two years, I&apos;ve held two editor positions, which has inevitably had added perks: overnight shifts, a newfound love for coffee and the opportunity to photograph Hillary Clinton and Coldplay. Admittedly, I&apos;ve enjoyed the latter two benefits over the former two. Walking past that foyer of Kerckhoff has become automatic. Kerckhoff 118 to me is where there is never a dull moment, somewhere I simultaneously find a sense of purpose and a source of refuge. I began to watch myself transform into one of those purposed editors with a job to do and limited time in which to get it done. What once seemed unachievable had become normal.
<br><br>
As I fell into this routine, I began to take notice of a sign that is hung by our editor in chief&apos;s office that reminds us to be bold (and italic). The Bruin has come a long way due to our boldness. In the past year, I have had the opportunity to watch our boldness win us a Pacemaker award. The Bruin has a history of excellence that we simply fell into. Late runs left me in the office past deadline a few times, and the one thing that never ceased to amaze me was how the office is never empty.
<br><br>
If there is one thing I carry with me, it is the sense of pride that The Bruin has instilled in me for the work we do. This pride made the extra hours, cups of coffee and few nights donated to the office all worth it. In the years to come, flipping through our award-winning magazine will remind me of this important lesson I learned during my time here.
<br><br>
Though my time here has come to an end, I find the values I&apos;ve learned from this one small bit of campus are virtually boundless. One thing remains certain: The Daily Bruin most certainly takes you places. Through that foyer of Kerckhoff 118 was where I found a home on this campus. It was where my editors believed in me and where I found confidence in myself.

                    <p>Every layout I design starts as a blank page in my unlined notebook. But finally sitting down staring at yet another blank page, I had a difficult time finding the words to start this column. I was at a loss, despite the dozens of ledes that have been marinating in my mind since I found out about this tradition what feels like a lifetime ago.
<br><br>
Perhaps it is because it feels premature. Perhaps because this is not the end I expected. Fixated on the finality of this column, I found myself lost at the end of an unfinished story.
<br><br>
But every end has a beginning, and mine began on a hot August afternoon in 2009. Thinking back, I wouldn&apos;t be signing off today if I hadn&apos;t fought the urge to leave that first day of yearbook class.
<br><br>
It felt natural for me to apply for Daily Bruin fall quarter freshman year, as something to do while shopping around for other extracurriculars. I never imagined I would stay on to join a Pacemaker award-winning editor team.
<br><br>
As a designer, I never got that rush of excitement seeing my name printed for the first time. I wouldn&apos;t be able to pick out my first design from a stack of issues, even if there were only two to choose from. The first time my name was printed was in Graduation Issue two years ago, which I typed out in 7-point font buried among dozens of others in the staff box.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, before long, I was willingly imprisoning myself in this mid-campus castle&apos;s dungeon full of familiar faces and familiar chaos that I simultaneously loved and hated. It was a real, unromanticized family filled with drama and tension, which was inevitable considering the sheer amount of time spent together. But now, the familiarity is fading away as fresh new faces start their journey, and a part of me envies their passionate enthusiasm.
<br><br>
The beauty of the Daily Bruin is that everything is passed down from editor to intern, year after year. As we hand over the publication each generation, things change, but our investment lives on, a part of the bigger Bruin legacy.
<br><br>
I hope that someday decades from now, an intern will unearth a lingering copy of prime, flip through the yellowing pages and find something to be inspired by.
<br><br>
But while our legacy is left for others to discover, it is the daily experience that I will take with me.
<br><br>
For the past years, the newsroom has been a haven. At such a large and competitive school, it&apos;s comforting to have a place where I felt competent and confident, surrounded by inspirational people, always motivating me to be more informed, more eloquent, more cultured.
<br><br>
It&apos;s true, I gave up a lot for this publication: countless hours of sleep, a chunk of my GPA, my sanity and probably a few years of my life from breathing the Kerckhoff dust. But I gained more: the ability to eyeball a pica, to hand model, to create last-minute illustrations, to function under the stress of a perpetual group project and of course, the friends who shared long nights waiting for a job that hardly pays to pay off. Standing at the end of this road, I realize that while not joining Daily Bruin would have probably made my college experience easier, it wouldn&apos;t be my college experience without it.
<br><br>
As I finish these last grafs, I already feel bitterness fading into a sweet aftertaste. I won&apos;t remember the Daily Bruin by the articles I wrote, the layouts I designed or this final column. Someday, I might even think of money before meetings when someone says &quot;budget,&quot; though I don't think I&apos;ll ever be able to stand the smell of Panda Express.
<br><br>
In 30 years, I will remember the trivial memories: stopping by Din Tai Fung on the way to retreat, staring deliriously at the newspapers covering the ceiling during late-run shifts, sending the editor in chief puppy GIFs at 5 a.m. during Registration Issue production, conducting phone interviews in the Trader Joe&apos;s parking lot and setting off the alarm while running into a Sunday budget meeting late.
<br><br>
In the end, as cliched as it sounds, I&apos;ll remember Daily Bruin by the people. In 30 years, most of us will likely be out of touch. But I know that wherever we are and whatever we end up being &ndash; doctors, lawyers and perhaps even the occasional journalist &ndash; we can all think back and remember the days we sat in a stuffy room and made a newspaper because we could. And despite the countless times we felt demoralized, disheartened and disenchanted, we were damn good at it.
<br><br>
These are the glory days I will take with me.

When I was 4, I remember sliding on my swim fins and jumping into the shimmery pool, pretending that I was a mermaid. Admittedly, it was a small plastic kiddie pool, but ever since then, there has always been something so fascinating about the water and its warm touch.
<br><br>

When I was around that age, I also remember swimming in the bathtub with my snorkels still attached to my mouth and falling asleep. I awoke to my horrified parents &ndash; who thought that I had drowned &ndash; lifting me out of the tub and performing CPR on me.

<br><br>
Fifteen summers later, I happened upon a Daily Bruin application for copy editing, and I eagerly dived at the opportunity. In many ways, my beginning years at the Daily Bruin as a copy editor were much like my younger years as a swimmer.

<br><br>
I always was, and still am, fascinated by the way that all the writers&apos; and editors&apos; hard work is turned into a shiny, tangible student newspaper the next day. I can also recall the numerous times I've dozed off during the middle of a grueling shift on the comfortable green chaise by the A&amp;E section after pulling several all-nighters.

<br><br>
As I joined a swim team in my later years, I loved the daily routine of swimming laps around the pool. Everything I did was systematized, from mentally keeping track of time to calculating the precise movements that it would take to execute a perfect flip turn.

<br><br>
Correspondingly, as I became a slot editor, I appreciated the same predictability and organization that my job provided me. I was able to determine how I should distribute my time to each duty of checking stories for factual errors, inaccurate headlines and misplaced ads in order to meet deadline &ndash; and partly so that I could sneak in an hour of swimming before bed.

<br><br>
But my shifts didn&apos;t always go as perfectly planned &ndash; stories were sometimes unexpectedly cut or added, some games ran longer than scheduled or a breaking news post would throw me off track. While it was difficult getting used to the unpredictability of my schedule at first, it was precisely these types of days that made me realize that sticking to routines and going with the tides of perfection wasn&apos;t always the best game plan.

<br><br>
The days I&apos;ll treasure most are the ones I stayed with fellow editors making spontaneous runs to In-N-Out or 800 Degrees Pizza and bonding in the office until 3 or 4 a.m. as we waited for the printer to pick up our phone calls. The moments I&apos;ll remember most are the ones we spent helping each other and working together way past the time that should be deemed healthy for college students to stay in a windowless room underneath a sea of dusty piled papers.

<br><br>
The mere three years I&apos;ve spent at the Daily Bruin have given me so much more than the 18 years I&apos;ve spent swimming: a true sense of camaraderie, and a true sense of belonging somewhere that&apos;s not underwater. Working at the Daily Bruin has helped me break out of my protective bubble and taught me that sometimes you have to embrace uncertainty and unpredictability and swim in deeper and darker waters to find bigger and better treasures.

<br><br>
As the new wave of editors and writers comes on board to experience the ebb and flow of the Daily Bruin office, I have one thing left to say: Just enjoy the ride.

                    <div class="author">Gene Block</div>
                    <div class="bio">Block is the chancellor of UCLA.</div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>
                        One of the most profound responsibilities I have as UCLA&apos;s chancellor is working with our exceptional faculty and staff to ensure that our graduating students are prepared for life beyond our campus  &ndash; ready to become leaders in their professions and in their communities. In some ways, that responsibility is made much easier because of the caliber of students who are attracted to UCLA. As the class of 2015 has again demonstrated, Bruins possess a wealth of talent, sense of purpose and depth of compassion for one another that are second to none.
<br><br>
We strive to offer our students a college education and experience that is among the world&apos;s very best. During your time here, you have collaborated with faculty recognized as the top in their fields and you have taken advantage of a wealth of extracurricular activities, including volunteer opportunities and civic engagement throughout Los Angeles. Our city is a mecca of innovation and a richly multicultural environment that is, in many ways, a microcosm of our broader society &ndash; which makes it perfect for tapping into new trends, testing new technologies and understanding where our nation and our world are headed.
<br><br>
Certainly, these factors give you, our students, a leg up in preparing to become our next generation of leaders and innovators. But the challenge encompasses so much more, in part because the world is constantly changing and the demands on new graduates are steadily increasing. Today more than ever, the workplace demands professionals who understand how to work effectively with diverse colleagues and constituents.
<br><br>
Study after study shows that companies, teams and organizations are more innovative and more competitive when they are made up of people with diverse talents, ideas and backgrounds. Fortunately, another of UCLA&apos;s defining characteristics is the magnificent diversity of our community &ndash; the fact that this is a place where brilliant people from across the globe and from different socioeconomic backgrounds come together to teach, learn, create and discover.
<br><br>
At UCLA, as at other leading research institutions of the world, scholars are increasingly tackling the most complex challenges they face by drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines. That&apos;s why we&apos;re proud to be the home of renowned centers like the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and the California NanoSystems Institute, to name two of many, where students and faculty are solving major societal and scientific problems by collaborating with experts from fields outside of their own.
<br><br>
In the same way, I believe, all of us can &ndash; and must &ndash; do our parts to help build a better, fairer and more just society by gaining insights and understanding of the worldviews of people who have different life experiences from our own.
<br><br>
This is one of the many reasons I was proud that this year, after years of effort by many of our students and faculty, the Academic Senate approved the establishment of an undergraduate diversity requirement for the College of Letters and Science. Beginning this fall, undergraduates will fulfill the new requirement by passing a course, in any one of a variety of disciplines, that examines racial, ethnic, gender, socioeconomic, sexual orientation, age, national origin, religious or other types of diversity.
<br><br>
Now, as you prepare to move into the next phase of your lives, I encourage you to carry forward the same principles to your future studies, your work and your communities. Seek opportunities to address challenging issues by collaborating with others rather than excluding them, by pursuing understanding rather than settling for ignorance and by embracing and utilizing the unique talents and life experiences that others possess. Wherever your interests lie and wherever your passions take you, never stop learning  &ndash; about yourself, your family, your profession and the world around you.
<br><br>
To the class of 2015: You have thrived at UCLA and have immeasurably enriched our remarkable community. As you celebrate commencement and take the next steps on your journey, know that you are prepared to make your mark, to forge new discoveries, to help improve others&apos; lives and to make our world a better place.
<br><br>
Congratulations!

                    <div class="bio">Lew was an opinion columnist from 2013-2015.</div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>To a windowless, musty, dirty, rowdy Kerckhoff 118, otherwise known as the Daily Bruin newsroom,
<br><br>
This is a love letter to a place I&apos;m not supposed to be.
<br><br>
Your walls need windows, I never seem to be funny enough to get a quote on the wall and sometimes I think that you&apos;re just storage space for broken office chairs. There's a type of girl I imagine you breed &ndash; with thick skin and unfaltering courage &ndash;  and I don&apos;t think I&apos;m supposed to be her.
<br><br>
And yet, here I am. I don&apos;t know how many times I walked past your table at activity fairs, deleted blank applications and told myself that I was done with journalism before I found my way back to you, but the moment I did, you became my favorite indulgence.
<br><br>
With an eight-letter byline, you taught me how to make this campus my own.
<br><br>
You let me write down in real words and print on real paper that I value student voices, that I want more from campus campaigns and institutions trying to make changes and that I seriously cannot deal with the state of Los Angeles&apos; sidewalks. You let me tell stories of recovering substance abusers, witnesses of police brutality and origami enthusiasts. When I was abroad, writing a travel column for you meant I could write down what shade of blue the sky was every day and how jasmine green tea with honey transported me back to sick days in the UCLA dorms.
<br><br>
You proved to me that every story on this campus matters, including my own. Some days, I think that inking my words onto newspaper is the only way to make sure my experiences are real. And somehow, two years of writing columns cemented four years of memories.
<br><br>
There&apos;s a mantra you taught me that we columnists chant in the Opinion section, where I&apos;ve made my home within your home. It&apos;s designed to encourage us to pitch important stories: What makes you angry? I still freeze every time I hear it, still feel a pang of resentment that you&apos;re demanding something of me that I can&apos;t give. Nothing! I want to confess. I don&apos;t like conflict. I still stare anxiously at the call button on my phone until the screen blanks out and I have to dial a source&apos;s number all over again. I'm not supposed to be here.
<br><br>
&quot;Supposed to&quot; is a funny thing, and a dangerous one, too. To be honest, I can&apos;t remember the last time I knew what I was supposed to do. It certainly wasn&apos;t when I moved to Los Angeles, spent a summer abroad getting lost in borrowed spaces, picked my major or even every afternoon when I climbed onto the Royce ledges (third from the right, against whichever pillar is parallel to sunlight) and did your crossword puzzle instead of my homework.
<br><br>
&quot;Supposed to&quot; made me question what my place was on a 419 acre campus of more than 40,000 other students. It made me question what one of the quietest students in a classroom could possibly have to say on your pages (a lot of things, it turns out).
<br><br>
But I&apos;m going to say something now that goes against my every basic instinct you gave me as a journalist: sometimes, don&apos;t question it.
<br><br>
The things we love have a way of following us, whether it&apos;s because we&apos;re looking for them or because they are so deeply a part of us. So when I find purpose in your clubhouse of hopelessly hopeful, stubbornly curious, annoyingly ambitious caffeine junkies, I just give in. I exhale long-buried anger in the form of a perfect lede and give it sharp teeth in the form of a perfect closing. I find my own voice while giving one to others.
<br><br>
You pushed me, made me care, made me brave and most of all, made me honest.
<br><br>
And if I was never supposed to love you for that, I&apos;m not sorry that I did anyway.
<br><br>
Thanks,
<br><br>
Chloe

                    <p>I&apos;ve had more than a few near-death experiences.
<br><br>
There&apos;vs the time I almost fell off the 3-foot-high branch on a tree in my backyard when I was 6. There&apos;vs the time I had to get a cast on my arm after my brother threw a block at it. And of course, there&apos;s the time I almost toppled over a railing at Mount St. Helens and nearly plummeted thousands of feet down to my death.
<br><br>
Some real harrowing stuff.
<br><br>
None of that, however, comes close to the terror I felt during my four-day stay in Memphis last year.
<br><br>
Joined by fellow basketball beat writer Andrew Erickson and two photographers &ndash; Tim Bradbury and Lexy Atmore &ndash; I was in town to cover UCLA men&apos;s basketball&apos;vs 2014 Sweet 16 matchup against Florida.
<br><br>
Immediately upon arriving in Memphis, I felt distinctly out of place. The blue skies and swanky establishments of Westwood were replaced by foreboding gray clouds spanning the horizons and crumbling brick buildings. Each 10-step trip from the motel room to the rental car door was a race against an army of people asking for money and literally the clothes off our backs. I was not in Kansas anymore.
<br><br>
Andrew and I flew in first, then returned to the airport late that night to pick up Tim. Famished, Tim suggested we stop at Jack in the Box for a midnight meal and looked up directions. As we navigated the streets toward the restaurant, I noticed a distinct change in scenery. The twinkling lights of the city&apos;s downtown were gone, replaced by what appeared to be a burned-down fire station. A bad omen if there ever was one.
<br><br>
As we turned onto the directions&apos;v final street, the mood got darker &ndash; the street lights were burnt out, casting ominous shadows on every building. And judging by the condition of these houses, it was clear we were not in the friendliest of neighborhoods.
<br><br>
A quick Google search confirmed what these dilapidated buildings and what the crack den behind our motel suggested: Memphis was ranked the nation&apos;s No. 2 most dangerous city by Forbes, after Detroit.
<br><br>
Trained in street smarts by a variety of movies and TV shows, I was convinced every shadow and every cat that darted across the street was in fact a platoon of gunmen, hell-bent on sending me to the grave for entering its territory.
<br><br>
Eventually, Siri broke the eerie silence, blurting out, &quot;You have arrived at your destination.&quot; Our destination was not, however, a Jack in the Box. Well, technically I guess it was: Jack &apos;n the Box Day Care Center, an abandoned building with its roof caved in that no parent would willingly send their child to.
<br><br>
At that point, we gave up on ordering Munchie Meals, focusing solely on returning to our hotel in one piece. But like the setting of any nightmare, there was no easy way out. We hoped to find a major road to turn onto to get off this street and return to properly lit, safer territory, but apparently this road had no intersections. After a mile of venturing deeper, we eventually U-turned, booking it back to the city&apos;s center and safety.
<br><br>
It may have been the wrong Jack in the Box and a dangerous foray into a bad part of town late at night, but it also made for a moderately amusing story. More than just exemplifying my irrational fear of places without street lights, this experience represents something more to me &ndash; something about my past and my future.
<br><br>
Allow me to take a brief detour.
<br><br>
I never wanted to get involved in journalism. After years of good grades on English essays in high school, I reluctantly gave into my mom&apos;s suggestion and replaced jazz band on my schedule with journalism. It seemed like a foolish move at first, tossing aside a music group to which I had dedicated my past five years in order to focus on writing, which had always been a chore, not a passion.
<br><br>
Six years later, that foolish move has allowed me to travel across the country; interact with future, current and former professional athletes; share the stories of some truly inspiring people; meet an incredible group of friends; and create some amazing memories that will last a lifetime.
<br><br>
So now, as I stare in panic at page upon page of job openings, completely clueless about which career path I want to take, I think back on that dimly lit Memphis street and feel some inkling of serenity that escaped me at the time.
<br><br>
Sometimes the wrong turns lead to the right destinations. Other times, they nearly get you killed. But hey, what&apos;s life without a little adventure?

                    <p>
In my four years at the Daily Bruin, I&apos;ve written 64 columns.
<br><br>
This is my 65th, and my last.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve long believed that columns are really just glorified arguments. And there are few things more personal than an argument.
<br><br>
Arguments betray who you are &ndash; how you think, what you believe and what you value. An argument is a testament to self, to valuing your own words and thoughts enough that you feel they deserve to be heard.
<br><br>
Which, frankly, is why I&apos;m still baffled that I decided to join the Daily Bruin fall quarter of my freshman year. I can think of no other time in my life when I valued myself less.
<br><br>
When I started college, I hated myself. I was depressed, lonely and frightened. I thought I was worthless, unlikable and ugly.
<br><br>
For my first two years at UCLA, my self-loathing kept me self-contained, and I didn&apos;t make many friends. My lack of friends only perpetuated my belief in my own freakishness.
<br><br>
I won&apos;t say anything magical happened when I joined the Daily Bruin, not initially at least. I struggled to make friends on staff, was terrified of my editors and felt incompetent. I told myself my writing was never good enough, my thoughts never worthy.
<br><br>
And I probably would have gone on that way, blundering through a series of what I perceived to be mediocre columns, if I hadn&apos;t decided to take fall quarter off of school my junior year and enter a medical weight-loss program in North Carolina.
<br><br>
Three thousand miles from home, away from school and pressure, I finally had time to breathe. On a whim, I decided to pitch an unconventional column to the editor of our arts and culture magazine, prime.
<br><br>
&quot;I want to write about being fat,&quot; I told her. &quot;I think I have something to say.&quot;
<br><br>
So I did.
<br><br>
I wrote about my shame and my pain and my loneliness. The ugly looks and nasty things people had said to me at UCLA. I wrote about what it feels like to be an outcast for a shallow reason, to be ridiculed, to feel like a freak.
<br><br>
I thought writing it would help me feel less ashamed.
<br><br>
What I was most worried about when I published that column was that it would confirm what I already thought about myself. That people would laugh at me. As though if by acknowledging my otherness &ndash; my weight &ndash; that my peers would finally have the license to truly shun me in the way I felt I deserved.
<br><br>
Instead, it went viral.
<br><br>
Emails and Facebook messages poured in from around the country &ndash; kind words from college students, old ladies and teenage girls. People told me their stories, shared their pain. They said I was inspiring and brave.
<br><br>
Which is pretty cool to hear when you think you&apos;re worthless.
<br><br>
When I came back to campus that January, people would stop me in the halls or at parties to tell me how moved they were by my story &ndash; that they didn&apos;t know, but now they did.
<br><br>
I didn&apos;t realize it at the time, but what that story really was to me was a coming out of sorts.
<br><br>
It was standing up and saying, I&apos;m different, I&apos;ve been through some shit, and I&apos;m not going to pretend it doesn&apos;t matter. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could be honest about the way I walked through the world. I didn&apos;t have to explain it every time I met someone new or pretend it didn&apos;t exist &ndash; I had already come clean.
<br><br>
It felt exhilarating. And more importantly, it gave me the confidence to push myself, to make friends, to find things in myself I admire.
<br><br>
Some days I still struggle, but I&apos;m getting better.
<br><br>
I think the thing I am most proud of leaving behind as my legacy at this paper is not only having the guts to tell my story, but more importantly, helping other people on our staff share theirs. The personal stories I edited for prime magazine this year are the work I am most proud of.
<br><br>
I think the best lesson I&apos;ve learned in my time at UCLA is that everyone has a burden, some part of themselves they&apos;re ashamed to own. Everyone carries baggage.
<br><br>
And you can&apos;t shed that baggage, it&apos;s part of who you are. But as soon as you drag it out of the shadows and into the sun, it becomes easier to carry.
<br><br>
Every single day, I still struggle to do that. But I&apos;m getting better.

The most underrated college experience is failure.
<br><br>
For the past four years, I&apos;ve written stories about arts and entertainment that range in topics &ndash; from a pie contest to the JazzReggae Festival to horror films to furniture art installations to celebrity sightings. It&apos;s almost always been unexpected, but amazing nonetheless.
<br><br>
But behind every article, there&apos;s an even better story I didn&apos;t tell. You never got to hear how many classes I skipped to schedule interviews with Robert Zemeckis or Josh Hutcherson. You&apos;d never know that I visited professor Robert Watson&apos;s home to talk about Shakespeare, or that I got a Baskin-Robbins ice cream with screenwriter Ed Neumeier and talked about the military, or that I charmed my way onto a red carpet for American Idol when there weren&apos;t enough press passes.
<br><br>
Just like the good stories went unheard, I left out the bad bits as well. I would often angrily swear and yell in the Daily Bruin office as I struggled to rewrite stories after six rounds of edits. I would fight with editors over literally one word because I thought it better captured the essence of the subject. I almost quit after my second year.
<br><br>
It&apos;s important to understand that the stories in these articles extend beyond the 700 words you might choose to skim through between classes. The interviews I conducted to write those articles, at least 90 hours of recorded content, were where I gained some of the most critical lessons I learned in college.
<br><br>
Generally, all of the subjects I wrote about were in the paper for one reason: They were successful.
<br><br>
It doesn&apos;t take a genius to figure that out, but success wasn&apos;t what compelled a reader to finish an article.
<br><br>
The real thing all my subjects had in common was that they struggled to get where they were. &quot;Family Guy&quot; showrunner Steve Callaghan said he used to perform in Kerckhoff Coffeehouse with the UCLA Comedy Club and was received with dirty looks from students trying to study.
<br><br>
Across these hundreds of interviews I conducted, I found that success is tied inextricably to failure. Yet, as successful UCLA students, we often want to cut that part of our own stories out with an elegant set of ellipses. So the best advice I can offer is to try something and fail. Then try something else. More than once if possible.
<br><br>
Failure is the best teacher for developing skills such as resilience, grace and perseverance. These are the parts of your story that will be most defining and memorable, and it&apos;s a story you should be proud to share.
<br><br>
Whenever I asked famous alumni for advice to Bruins, it was never to take an extra class or get close to a professor.
<br><br>
&quot;RoboCop&quot; actor Peter Weller said I ought to start listening to flamenco music. Actress Yvonne DeLaRosa said she regretted not spending more time in the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. They said to enjoy myself.
<br><br>
What I&apos;ve learned from these many interviews with successful people is that success is what you make of it. Sometimes a mistake is just a blessing in disguise.
<br><br>
So change your major, audition for an a cappella group, dance at the Bruin Bear, study abroad, go on a terrible Tinder date or quit the job you hate. Fail at something and embrace your rock-bottom moments.
<br><br>
But please, don&apos;t let a little writer&apos;s block get in the way of writing your story.

                        Sports are my life. They always have been and likely always will be.
<br><br>
As a youngster, if I wasn&apos;t out on the baseball field, I was usually at home watching games on television.
<br><br>
However, my skills on the diamond never came close to matching my ability in the classroom. Regardless, I continued to study sports as if they were my homework.
<br><br>
Even if I couldn&apos;t play sports for a living, I&apos;ve always known that I&apos;ve wanted to work in sports. It was just a matter of figuring out what to do.
<br><br>
The Daily Bruin gave me that opportunity and an outlet to put my wealth of knowledge to the test and to write about UCLA sports.
<br><br>
I attended UCLA specifically to write for this newspaper. Yet if you had asked that wide-eyed freshman four years ago if this would be the first and only column that I&apos;d write for The Bruin, I wouldn&apos;t have believed you.
<br><br>
But such is life. You never know how it&apos;s going to turn out. Even though I was never an editor, I was still highly involved with the paper during my four years on campus. And that&apos;s something I would not trade for anything.
<br><br>
Not only did it open so many doors for me in the sports industry, it also allowed me to make many memories covering events and spending time with friends.
<br><br>
Among all the different sporting events I&apos;ve covered, I am thankful that I had the chance to witness Novak Djokovic and Pete Sampras play tennis on a makeshift court in Pauley Pavilion. Another favorite moment of mine was covering a college baseball game at a stadium I&apos;ve been to hundreds of times at the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic.
<br><br>
And I would be foolish if I didn&apos;t mention how much pride I take in the Daily Bruin going 4-0 against the Daily Trojan in our annual Blood Bowl flag football games during my time at UCLA. Playing in these games, along with intramural sports and pickup basketball, with my friends at the paper over the years have been among some of my best days on campus.
<br><br>
It is moments like these that I&apos;ll never forget &ndash; including when I broke my finger in an IM football game.
<br><br>
One last thing I&apos;d like to mention is that athletes are often misunderstood by people who don&apos;t get to interact with them on an everyday basis. The Bruin provided a platform for me to remember that despite all they do on the field or court, athletes are still people too, and that&apos;s something that is overlooked far too often.
<br><br>
They are just often in the spotlight and answering the questions, rather than asking them. I have gained so much respect for the student-athletes here at UCLA for how much effort they put into representing the four letters across their chest, all while dealing with classes and the other dilemmas of being a college student.
<br><br>
Getting to understand their personal stories, the adversity that they have overcome and how UCLA has played a part in what they hope to accomplish after college or in their professional careers has always been the best part of the job.
<br><br>
Just as these student-athletes have UCLA to thank for helping them advance in their careers, I know that when I finally do reach the major leagues in my own sports career, I&apos;ll have the Daily Bruin to thank for being the steppingstone to my success.

                    <p>
                        Despite the trouble and turmoil of this academic year, I am extremely proud to have led the 2014-2015 Undergraduate Students Association Council.
<br><br>
This year, we worked to safeguard the affordability of the University of California as we rallied, lobbied and petitioned to prevent another tuition hike. We also established measures to cut day-to-day costs for students through the creation of Lab Coat Loaner Library and the unveiling of the first transportation scholarship.
<br><br>
We implemented one of the first student-initiated mobile safety applications in the country with our UCLA mobile app, Circle of 6, which drew praise from the White House. We brought greater awareness to mental health on campus through the councilwide All of Us campaign. We partnered with students, alumni and faculty to win the 30-year fight to establish a diversity coursework requirement in the College of Letters and Science. We elected the first transfer student representative and displayed our commitment to making UCLA&apos;s resources available to all students. We installed new solar panels on the roof of Ackerman Union and educated students about the California drought. We even made North Korea&apos;s Kim Jong Un tremble as we screened a world-exclusive preview of &quot;The Interview.&quot; At its core, USAC&apos;s mission is to make UCLA more excellent &ndash; more affordable, more safe, more inclusive, more sustainable and more fun. And this year, I believe we did just that.
<br><br>
As I look toward next year, I charge the incoming council to address two particular issues. First, USAC must work overtime to regain the trust of its constituents. Between inappropriate social media postings, appointment hearings that contained discriminatory lines of questioning or the recent allegations that a political slate used student government money to fund its campaign, USAC has been no stranger to controversy this year. Students are disillusioned with USAC, and it is up to USAC to win back the student body&apos;s trust. In my view, there is only one way to regain this goodwill: to put forth relevant initiatives and programs that benefit the student body and communicate with transparency and integrity the resources that are being used to put these on. USAC has tremendous value to the student experience, and it must do a better job of communicating this value.
<br><br>
Secondly, USAC must actively strive to better our campus climate. In a world dominated by social media, a student&apos;s negative experience quickly becomes the experience of an entire community. Further, conflicts around the world travel across borders, languages, Tumblr and Snapchat to become local conflicts right here on campus. Unfortunately, rather than serving as a platform to build cross-cultural connections, social media too often serves as a tool to reinforce the worldview that we already subscribe to and blast those who don&apos;t agree. Whether we like it or not, social media is here to stay. We can&apos;t turn the clock back now.
<br><br>
But in a world in which our connection to each other is reduced to a Facebook friend request and in which we interact through 140 characters, USAC can help better campus climate by pushing for deep, prolonged and in-person engagements between students from different value systems. Our individual stories are unique, and our identities are intersectional; however, the human ability to reflect, empathize and learn is universal.
<br><br>
The problems I have laid out do not have simple solutions. But to paraphrase John F. Kennedy, we choose to address issues not because they are easy but precisely because they are hard and will serve to bring out the best of our energies and skills. There are no better young people to face these issues than the Bruins of UCLA and the capable hands of the 2015-2016 council.

                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>I have answered the all-too-familiar &quot;What do you want to do with your life?&quot; questions that pervade family gatherings in the same way for more than a decade now.
<br><br>
&quot;I want to be a journalist.&quot;
<br><br>
But before college, I didn&apos;t really know what that meant.
<br><br>
I was the editor in chief of my monthly high school paper, but the stakes were low and the deadlines none too pressing.
<br><br>
So when I got to UCLA, I knew the next step was to join the college newspaper and continue on to my illustrious career as a journalist.
<br><br>
But when the deadline came to apply for the Daily Bruin, I pulled up the application and found myself a bit daunted, scared to step into such a big pool.
<br><br>
What if I failed? Or worse, what if I discovered I didn&apos;t actually like journalism? Not just writing and keeping up on current events, but combining the two to actively be the one to inform, to ask the tough questions and to understand the answers. Could I handle the stress?
<br><br>
I didn&apos;t apply right away, partly because I&apos;d just gotten to school and was figuring it all out, but partly because of these lingering questions.
<br><br>
The next quarter, I decided to commit, filling out the way-too-long News application we&apos;ve since downsized. When I got a call for an interview, I was nervous, but I went in and did my best.
<br><br>
I got in, and the rest is a blur. I was only on the paper for two quarters before I was asked to step into an assistant News editor position, filling and editing daily news content, which was an even bigger responsibility than I realized at the time. During my time, I was also the enterprise editor, overseeing investigative and longer-term content, but this is besides the point.
<br><br>
Amid the myriad other skills the paper helped me gain, including presenting myself professionally, researching, writing and working under deadline, one of the most important things The Bruin did for me was make me step out of my comfort zone.
<br><br>
UCLA as a whole does this for most students, but I view my personal growth largely through the lens of the newspaper, because it&apos;s impossible for me to reflect on my college experience in any other way.
<br><br>
When I was a first-year student and intern at The Bruin, one of my early assignments was to attend an exhibition at the Fowler Museum to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Japan earthquake. I remember my hand shaking slightly as I held my notebook and pen, standing and looking around, knowing I had to go up and talk to random attendees. Once I sat down with some people, including one international student who had been in Japan when the disaster hit and who turned out to be an invaluable source, it got easier. They were just people.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve since gotten used to walking up to and asking questions to random people and building relationships with continual sources, for that matter.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve reported on the 2012 presidential election, shaken hands with Kofi Annan, interviewed the University of California president, filed stories from UC Board of Regents meetings in the state capital and San Francisco and sauntered the streets of Westwood with a then-campaigning, Diddy Riese-laden Eric Garcetti.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve doggedly pursued public records requests and parsed thousands of pages of documents to investigate misdoings on the part of companies and university officials, and asked said people directly about them.
<br><br>
But I still get nervous every time I pick up the phone or sit down to talk to an important source.
<br><br>
However, whereas my initial shakiness at the Fowler was a symptom of entering the field, I now view having a little bit of nerves as a benefit. (And somewhat of a necessity since coffee is involved.)
<br><br>
Though I&apos;m somewhat cynical and even known around the office for my sass, the fact that I&apos;m apprehensive about getting my facts right, about not misrepresenting sources or situations, whatever it may be, is proof to me that I&apos;m not done with journalism &ndash; that I will constantly work toward getting it right &ndash; and that I still care.
<br><br>
As I prepare to take on the real world of reporting, I find myself at the same crossroads as when I got to UCLA.
<br><br>
What if I fail? What if I don&apos;t enjoy it?
<br><br>
I&apos;m vastly better equipped to achieve my goals after working at the unbelievable, award-winning training ground of the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
Despite this, I am nervous. But that&apos;s okay. Better, even.

                        When I first decided to apply to the Daily Bruin, I expected that working as a video journalist would be exciting and glamorous. And to an extent, my expectations were met. I got VIP media passes to Outside Lands, flew in an airplane with a student who was also a pilot and sat with ex-gang members as their gang tattoos were laser-removed.
<br><br>
Beneath all the glamour, however, were the challenges of an endearingly problematic video department. The cameras never seemed to work. The tripods were always a little bit crooked. The computers would crash in the middle of editing.
<br><br>
But the imperfections and the struggles were part of what made journalism exciting and what made the storytelling real.
<br><br>
It was a constant reminder that real life is not a string of perfectly crafted words on a page or tastefully filtered images on a screen. It&apos;s raw, unexpected and hard. Real life is a series of successes, failures, trials, joys and sorrows. And for each of those moments in life, we need grace and we need community &ndash; people to run with us, pick us up when we fall and inspire us to run again.
<br><br>
That&apos;s where Daily Bruin and the Video section come in. At the Daily Bruin, I found myself in the company of people who were passionate about storytelling and using their creative talents to make a difference. A group of people who stood by the truth and who weren&apos;t afraid to shine a light in the dark places. The unglamorous challenges of meeting daily deadlines and dealing with malfunctioning equipment were worth it because of those close friendships I made along the way.
<br><br>
I expected a lot of things from working at the Daily Bruin, but the one thing I did not expect &ndash; the community &ndash; is one of the things that I will cherish the most.

                        I scramble for words whenever I try to give personal advice to friends.
<br><br>
I want to hear about people&apos;s problems, but I can&apos;t find anything inspiring to say back. It&apos;s hard to be encouraging when my own doubts are already through the roof.
<br><br>
My voice is also lacking just because I&apos;m thrown off by how people can so clearly articulate what they feel. Where I would stutter or go silent, their emotions flow out. How can they be that open about their insecurities?
<br><br>
During my first real breakup, my ex said there was a part of me he felt he could never reach. There were things I couldn&apos;t be honest about, that were shut down or closed off. I think I know what he was saying.
<br><br>
I hold my feelings back sometimes because it&apos;s easier and because I have this voice in my head telling me they don&apos;t have much merit. It&apos;s like I don&apos;t deserve to share them because I shouldn&apos;t be letting these minuscule problems get to me.
<br><br>
At the same time, I&apos;ve spent the majority of the past three years reporting for the Daily Bruin and trying to get people to share their secrets with me. They&apos;ve told me about the nagging regrets they have about missing campaigns or parties years ago, about their six-figure debt and shown me pictures and videos of their dead parents.
<br><br>
I feel inferior because I don&apos;t have the same nerve they do when they tell their stories. I&apos;m awed by them and what they say.
<br><br>
This column is uncomfortable to write because it&apos;s hard to tell people things about yourself for fear of being vulnerable. But I&apos;ve asked so much of people at UCLA during my three years on The Bruin &ndash; to be brave, to empathize with stories on our pages, to give me second chances &ndash; that it seems unfair that I wouldn&apos;t open up some too.
<br><br>
It&apos;s been easy to forget why I love the paper while working around the clock as an editor for two years. But I&apos;m reminded of why I love this job every time someone opens up to me &ndash; every time I find an eternal optimist on this campus.
<br><br>
They&apos;sre the students who go back to class after their professors call their home countries &quot;backwards,&quot; the people who travel across the country to get Chick-fil-A, the professors who testify when they witness racial discrimination and the artist who teaches painting to prisoners.
<br><br>
They put themselves out there, show you how many battles there are to fight and help you believe their goals could come true. I think they’re the reason I kept coming back to work &ndash; because they have some type of conviction in them I&apos;m still grasping for.
<br><br>
I think they would know what to say to friends when they&apos;re depressed, what to share and hold back, how to have faith and give it to others. I want the world to hear their stories, and I want people to care about what they have to say. I want to soak in everything they have to teach and unlearn some of my own cynicism.
<br><br>
Maybe then I&apos;ll deserve the friends I&apos;ve found here at UCLA or be able to tell the guy I like how I really feel. Maybe then, I&apos;ll have more of a story to tell one day.
<br><br>
Until that happens, Bekka, Gregory, Hana, Jason, Steven, Yael and Yasmin, thank you for carrying me through UCLA and for being the most inspiring people I&apos;ve ever met.
<br><br>
And thanks Daily Bruin, for giving me the chance to share this.
