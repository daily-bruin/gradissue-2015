                    <p>Any writer is familiar with the difficulty of deciding where to place the final period in a story and declare it complete. When breaking news still traveled by wire, journalists would tap "-30-" into their telegrams to signal the end of their transmissions. Graduating Daily Bruin staffers and UCLA community members share their wisdom, memories and the view from the end of another year in their -30- columns.

                    <div class="author">Sebastian Torrelio</div>
                    <div class="bio">Torrelio was an A&E senior staffer from 2014-2015 and an A&E film & television editor from 2013-2014.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>I must namecheck one individual in particular who is responsible for my career at the Daily Bruin: a tall, buffoonish caricature of James Bond&apos;s dashing looks called Aren Alexander. <br><br>

Alexander, a former Daily Bruin photographer, was my second-year roommate who, knowing that I loved movies far too much, forced me to apply as an intern that fall quarter. He is to blame for my presence at this organization and all formal and informal complaints should be sent his way.<br><br>

He was correct, however, in acknowledging that one of my main goals in life has been to become a film critic. Over the last three years I have manipulated my way through this establishment to a position that allows me to write about practically any movie that I want, so I would say I&apos;ve succeeded. Why anyone has permitted me to keep this much power for this long is beyond reason.<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll summarize my tyrannical bumbling through the Daily Bruin&apos;s Arts &amp; Entertainment section with a few brief memories. Initially, I had joined the paper under the reign of editor in chief James Barragan, a man whose overbearing charm has always subtly reminded me of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of fertility.
<br><br>
During my first year at the Daily Bruin, I started a nonsensical column titled &quot;Love|Hate,&quot; in which I and another A&amp;E writer (professional bearer of bad opinions Tony Huang) would speak briefly about entertainment topics we saw trending on Twitter that week. It grew very popular.<br><br>

At one point during a budget meeting, Barragan complimented my &quot;Love|Hate&quot; column for that week, which discussed the Marvel cinematic franchise. Barragan complimented me because I spoke highly of Iron Man, and he thought Iron Man was cool or something. It was the highlight of my Daily Bruin career.<br><br>

The following year, I applied to be a film &amp; television editor under the rule of Jillian Beck, a commanding woman who was very consistent in reminding her staffers that she loved the Boston Red Sox more than she loved any of them, not that anyone could blame her.<br><br>

The most intimate interaction I had with Beck while working as an editor occurred while I was writing a movie review, and she had noticed I mistakenly submitted the word &quot;twat&quot; when I meant to say &quot;twit.&quot; This error also describes my experience as a film editor pretty effectively.<br><br>

I spent much of my role as editor not editing for days at a time. It culminated in the week that I covered the American Film Institute festival, leaving my school, friends and job for eight straight days to watch foreign movies in Hollywood. The festival was a wonderful learning experience that I vigorously wrote about for A&amp;E&apos;s online blog Spotlight and, as such, my writings were never read by the general public.<br><br>

It is worth noting that after my stint as editor, my work with the Daily Bruin led to a summer editorial internship at Variety magazine. At Variety, I reported for the weekly print magazine, covered premiere events, conducted interviews with famous personalities, ate ice cream with J.K. Simmons, had smoke blown in my face by Leonardo DiCaprio and spent a night in a small hotel smoke room with Kid Cudi and his posse. The job had its highs and lows.<br><br>

This brings me to the past year, under editor in chief Andrew Erickson, a man who perfectly embodies what I believe Huey Lewis to have been like in his college years. I make daily rituals out of perpetually bothering everyone who comes in through the front entrance to our office and occasional games out of who I can bother most. I&apos;m suspicious as to why I haven&apos;t been fired yet.<br><br>

Being my last year, I have come to an interesting realization, though. There is no one at the Daily Bruin who I truly consider to be a long-time friend. I have made plenty of good friends, and have hung out, partied or otherwise had positive relationships with practically everyone on the main staff for my past three years at the paper.<br><br>

Yet I don&apos;t know if I will see a lot, if any, of the people that I have met at this organization again after I graduate. Perhaps that speaks to my own character, or the character of the people that I have worked with.<br><br>

I do hope I see some of them again, even if it must take some unrealized personal effort. I recognize now, almost three years after the fact, that joining the Daily Bruin purely to become a film critic was a hollow goal. At the very least, it&apos;s a hollow goal that I took the time to fulfill.<br><br>

                    <p>It was 9:05 p.m. in San Jose. I was at the 2013 California College Media Association awards with the editor in chief and the campus News editor. The Daily Bruin had just won 24 awards, and I was busy doodling a picture of my harp on the event&apos;s program.
<br><br>
This was emblematic of my past four years &ndash; always being in two places at once.
<br><br>
My second year at UCLA, I auditioned for the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music&apos;s ethnomusicology program and got in. My lifelong dream of becoming a musician was finally realized and coming true. I held that dream proudly in my hands and vowed to never let anything get in the way.
<br><br>
But like all dreams in Los Angeles, one wasn&apos;t enough.
<br><br>
In my third year, I became the broadcast producer for The Bruin&apos;s Radio department. I thought, &quot;I&apos;m tired of getting these uncertain looks when I tell people I&apos;m studying music. I need something more. I enjoy journalism and care about people. So, there&apos;s that.&quot;
<br><br>
Here at The Bruin, I watched people trade in extra hours of sleep for extra shots of espresso. I witnessed editors master the art of typing on the computer with one hand, tweeting an update with the other, all while talking on the phone, which would be crunched uncomfortably between their head and shoulder.
<br><br>
And after watching these ridiculous balancing acts day after day, I began to realize how unhappy I was.
<br><br>
Because I was jealous.
<br><br>
I was jealous to see these people go above and beyond for what they love to do &ndash; to get that voice heard, to get that story told. Meanwhile my true love, the harp, remained untouched in the basement of Schoenberg Music Building, as I stayed in a windowless office, editing a radio show that probably only 10 people had listened to that week.
<br><br>
I broke my vow to music for something I liked, but did not love.
<br><br>
And now I was thinking, I spent four years here and this may not be something I want to do. Was it a waste of time? Was The Bruin&apos;s name on my resume and the decent paycheck that paid the groceries worth it?
<br><br>
No.
<br><br>
But my friends were.
<br><br>
You see, I was missing the point. I had been caught up worrying too much about how I didn&apos;t spend my time, rather than how I did spend my time.
<br><br>
This was, and continues to be, a small but significant lesson I learn over and over again. I&apos;m an introvert, who relies on self-manufactured happiness, who enjoys being alone, and who has difficulty accepting love from others. Always living in the &quot;what-ifs&quot; and the &quot;what-can-be-done-nexts.&quot;
<br><br>
But the people here taught me that life is more than moments waiting to be checked off a list. They&apos;re moments waiting to be shared with others.
<br><br>
These were mine.
<br><br>
I remember when I was going through a tough time with my housing situation and couch-hopped for two weeks. One afternoon, I found myself crashed at the Radio desk, only to wake up to a care package filled with several boxes of soup, Cheerios and a note saying, &quot;I&apos;m here for you.&quot;
<br><br>
I remember when my grandpa passed away, and I quietly and strategically ran to the stairwell to cry in solitude. Minutes later, I felt someone sit next to me. It was a staffer who had noticed I left the office, and before I could say a word, gave me a hug.
<br><br>
I remember climbing rocks in the desert with another staffer and talking about our love for Jesus. We eventually created a Bible study within the Daily Bruin for Christians and those interested in Christianity. We called ourselves “DB Community Group” because that’s what it was: a community.
<br><br>
I remember laughing with friends over our weekly &quot;ice cream Mondays.&quot;
<br><br>
I don&apos;t have to be in two places at once to be successful, I don&apos;t need to be successful to be happy, and I don&apos;t need to be happy to be grateful. My friends helped me find the courage to recognize what I had in the moment, so I could finally tell myself, &quot;This is enough.&quot;
<br><br>
My friends were, are and will always be enough. I am grateful for each one of you.
<br><br>
I quit wrongly penalizing staffers in my head for loving The Bruin, I quit whining that I didn&apos;t make enough time for music, and I quit being hard on myself for thinking the best way to spend time was to do everything my way.
<br><br>
I didn&apos;t fall in love with The Bruin, and that&apos;s okay. This isn&apos;t my love story.
<br><br>
It&apos;s my thank-you note.
<br><br>
My dear friends &ndash; and you all know who you are &ndash; thank you for helping me realize that time spent in friendship is time well spent.<br/>

                    <p>Outside the Daily Bruin&apos;s editor in chief office hangs a black board encased within a plastic cover.
<br><br>
During my junior year as an assistant Sports editor, our editor in chief left two words scribbled in aqua blue up on the board:
<br><br>
Be bold.
<br><br>
I walked by that sign multiple times a day on my way into and out of the office that year.
<br><br>
From time to time, I&apos;d read it over.
<br><br>
Once in a while, maybe after a long day&apos;s work, I&apos;d knowingly place my hand on the case as I left the office.
<br><br>
Most times, though, I wouldn&apos;t even notice it.
<br><br>
But the words were always there, somewhere in my mind: Be bold.
<br><br>
That&apos;s what I wanted our Sports section to be.
<br><br>
That&apos;s how I wanted our writers to practice journalism.
<br><br>
And that&apos;s who I wanted to be.
<br><br>
Sometimes those words took another, more-vocal form: Go big.
<br><br>
Either way, the concept was the same.
<br><br>
That year, my fellow Sports editors and I tried things that had never been done before in the section, or at least hadn&apos;t been in a very long time.
<br><br>
We did full-page previews for football games, dubbing them &apos;Football Fridays.&apos;
<br><br>
We fought for and printed far more six-column, page-spanning stories than in previous years.
<br><br>
We even printed a one-story section front in a regular issue.
<br><br>
We pushed out four feature series in 11 weeks, more than in the entire section&apos;s previous four-year total.
<br><br>
We sent our writers out to conduct the newly-innovated idea of &quot;15-minute interviews,&quot; where they would casually talk to athletes, putting the onus on our writers to face uncertainty and steer the ship themselves.
<br><br>
The list goes on and on.
<br><br>
Some of the projects we did became the talk of the office.
<br><br>
Some of our ideas we innovated admired.
<br><br>
But not all of the things we did when we stepped out of line worked.
<br><br>
Some of them went pretty awry.
<br><br>
Maybe a series was forced.
<br><br>
Perhaps a once well-thought plan punctured.
<br><br>
Potentially, a writer became disappointed with us along the way.
<br><br>
But whether we were on the right or wrong side of the line was beside the point.
<br><br>
What mattered was the courage to step out of line.
<br><br>
To push the limits.
<br><br>
To say, &apos;Let&apos;s go big,&apos; and to hope it would work but not know, and to be okay with that.
<br><br>
That&apos;s the message I want to leave behind at the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
And it&apos;s the same message I want to embody going forward.
<br><br>
As a newly turned 22-year-old and soon-to-be college graduate, I have a lot of doubts and uncertainty about this thing called &quot;the rest of my life.&quot;
<br><br>
But one thing I know I have hammered out: Be bold.
<br><br>
Oh, and as for how our tale as Sports editors and a paper ended that year.
<br><br>
The Daily Bruin&apos;s 2013-2014 staff went on to win an Associated Press Pacemaker award for best college newspaper in the country.
<br><br>
Our Sports section went on to win the staff-voted award for &apos;Best Section.&apos;
<br><br>
But from that I learned endings sometimes aren&apos;t as important as the way you get there.<br/>

                    <p>I dread the emptiness of a blank white page and the impatience of a blinking cursor.
<br><br>
To confront that blankness, armed with nothing but a pen or a keyboard, a mind and maybe an idea, is intimidating.
<br><br>
And yet, it is something journalists and writers do constantly. They conquer the cursor, tell stories, weave data together and lay bare what was hidden or obscured.
<br><br>
For me, a blank page is a mirror. Every time I choose to fill this space, I imprint a piece of myself onto the world. I may not know what that imprint will look like before I start writing, and I know that the first draft is never the last. Yet each draft and revision gets me closer to representing who I am.
<br><br>
As an Opinion columnist at the Daily Bruin, I strove to fill these pages with the most honest reflection of myself I could muster. In some of my favorite pieces I laid myself bare &ndash; I wrote about my culture, my inner conflicts and my politics. I often started writing before I knew where it would lead me. In this way, the Daily Bruin allowed me to discover and solidify pieces of myself that I did not recognize or understand before.
<br><br>
Writing became my refuge. When grappling with difficult topics like Israel-Palestine, local government or campus climate while also navigating the personal challenges of college, it sometimes felt like everything around me was unstable and crumbling. But I could always anchor myself in words.
<br><br>
Journalism allowed me to lay bare other people&apos;s stories as well. I interviewed professors, students, administrators and government representatives who at their core were researchers, refugees, activists, allies and experts. I can only hope that individuals like these will continue to grant me the privilege of reporting their stories with the compassion and accuracy that they deserve.
<br><br>
Whether telling our own truths, or reporting on someone else&apos;s, writing is both a responsibility and an experiment. We learn to accept the beautiful tension between a proud final draft and the knowledge that it is never really finished. There is always something left unsaid, something worded incorrectly, something that sounds a bit clich&eacute;d.
<br><br>
As we prepare to graduate from UCLA, we live and breathe this tension. Every year is a blank page. Every day a blinking cursor. Every past and future class, test, relationship and job is a perpetual rough draft, with each one revealing something about who we are and imprinting it onto the world.
<br><br>
Thank you to the editors, critics and avid readers who make each blank page worth filling over and over again. And thank you to my mentors, friends and family, whose constant love and support has imprinted itself onto me.
<br><br>
It is now time to close this document &ndash; until the next draft.<br/>

                    <p>Over the course of three years, I have oftentimes found myself looking down at my phone at a particular set of words: &quot;Hey Jose, can you take a shoot?&quot; Despite the fact that I had received the same message time and time again, from multiple editors, it never failed to evoke the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as I put the phone down. After a few minutes of frantically running through my mental schedule, I&apos;d type up the usual response, &quot;Hey, sorry I&apos;m busy today,&quot; and not even pay it a second thought. 
<br><br>
Now, if you&apos;re like me, when you get to the end of a great read, there&apos;s always that little part of you that doesn&apos;t want to turn the page because you realize that once you do, that&apos;s it. The story ends and the words that captivated you the entire time slowly fade away, out of sight and out of mind. As my time as a Bruin slowly ticks down, I find myself constantly hoping that I don&apos;t have to turn the page, not on the time that I have left here at UCLA, but on the time left that I have with the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
You see, as three years of being a photographer for the Daily Bruin wrap up, I&apos;ve come to realize just how incredible the office really is.
<br><br>
From coming together to create incredible coverage of the LGBT community in Malawi to frantically responding to the Sunset Boulevard water main break that unfortunately graced our campus, I have never seen an office so full of individuals with a burning passion for journalism. Even when the Daily Bruin&apos;s independence was challenged last year, the cramped space that many generations before us have come to love was resilient and held firm.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve seen three years worth of editors in chief, top and assistant editors and countless contributors come and go. During each of these years, I&apos;ve seen lifelong friendships form, incredible job opportunities obtained and even a relationship or two come to fruition.
<br><br>
On the verge of commencement, the thought of walking through the front door of Kerckhoff Hall into the office for one of the last times makes me regret many things. I didn&apos;t take enough shoots. I should have made a bigger effort. Why did I not push myself as I saw so many other photogs do?
<br><br>
As this last worry comes to mind, I always find a way to stop myself. I think back to the excitement I felt when I was first training as a contributor. I think about the incredibly talented individuals that I&apos;ve met along the way, some of whom have gone on to shoot for Sports Illustrated, USA Today Sports and Getty Images. I think about the never-ending laughs, meme creations and stressed looks on editors&apos; faces and realize that I could not be any more grateful to have been a part of the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
People often worry because their plans go astray, and life doesn&apos;t work in their favor. Yet, what many fail to realize is that when you step onto this campus and feel the nostalgia wash over you as you stroll past your usual hangout spots, you&apos;ll realize that it was every event along the way to graduation that truly defined your four-year undergraduate journey.
<br><br>
My undergraduate journey was full of many events and much debauchery, but the Daily Bruin was always there. While I&apos;m still a long way off from my ultimate goal &ndash; medical school &ndash; being a Daily Bruin photographer has reinforced the wisdom my dad imparts to me every time I&apos;m about to start a new journey: La paciencia es un don.
<br><br>
Spanish for &quot;Patience is a virtue.&quot;

I didn&apos;t think it would be hard to write this column. 
<br><br>

Maybe that&apos;s odd. Writing something that accurately captures what I&apos;ve learned during my time writing for the Daily Bruin &ndash; that explains what it feels like to be here, right now, standing with one foot inside Kerckhoff 118 and the other out &ndash; probably should never have seemed easy.
<br><br>
But I thought it would be easy because it called for me to do the thing every opinion columnist worth her salt loves to do the most: talk about myself.
<br><br>
What have I learned? What has the paper meant to me? What advice can I impart?
<br><br>
My second-year self imagined what would strike me now as a dramatic soliloquy. Dramatic and entirely unjustified.
<br><br>
I don&apos;t know much. I&apos;m young, and the future rambles out in front of me every day in a new direction. I am balancing on a precipice, I am holding my breath.
<br><br>
In this half-paralyzed state of fear and wonder, sitting in a drafty old apartment in the dark a few days before I walk across a stage and leave the newsroom for good, I only really want to say this: The only things of value I have ever done at the Daily Bruin (or will ever do anywhere) have nothing at all to do with me.
<br><br>
If there&apos;s anything I&apos;ve learned writing about other people for the last three years, it&apos;s that I matter a lot less than I thought I did.
<br><br>
That might seem obvious or clich&eacute;d, but this knowledge is the most beautiful gift the Daily Bruin has given me.
<br><br>
I did not start out a journalist &ndash; I started out someone who liked to write, who liked to see my byline, who did this work because of what it might say about me.
<br><br>
That is an ugly truth to acknowledge. Other people might read that and think I&apos;m shitty &ndash; I would have two years ago.
<br><br>
But the truth is that I&apos;m not shitty&#x3B; I&apos;m normal. I am a self-focused person as we all are, and I worked really hard and wrote really well because I wanted to be impressive.There is a particular proclivity among writers, I think, to want to clamber up the world&apos;s tallest ladder and shout into a megaphone for everyone to hear: I am here! I am important! Look at me!
<br><br>
I did not know it and never would have said it at the time, but when I first started working here, that&apos;s what I was doing: shouting into a megaphone.
<br><br>
The most important thing I&apos;ve learned through my time here is that this struggle for selflessness and graciousness in the work that you do doesn&apos;t really end. Every time I write a story I have to consider who has the megaphone: Is it someone else&apos;s voice I&apos;m interested in amplifying here, or my own?
<br><br>
I am grateful to this institution for a lot of things, but mostly for humbling me greatly. I hope to keep that humility with me wherever I go, whether I&apos;m writing or not, for the rest of my life.

The best advice I received this year came from a high school senior.
<br><br>
Toward the end of a high school journalism club meeting, as the students were putting the finishing touches on the Weekly Cobra layout, we talked about the uncertain future of journalism and my uncertain future within that uncertain future.
<br><br>
&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how you get past the wall,&quot; said the newsletter&apos;s then-editor Victor, attributing his wisdom to a recent assembly speaker. &quot;Go through it, over it, under it &ndash; just as long as you get past it.&quot;
<br><br>
I found that line oddly comforting, not just for myself, but for the institution I leave behind after four years on staff.
<br><br>
I don&apos;t know what the college newspaper landscape will look like in five years. I&apos;m not naive about that outlook, but I do believe there will always be a place in student media for hardworking, thoughtful people.
<br><br>
If I know one thing, it&apos;s that people will continue to run through walls for the Daily Bruin. I&apos;ve seen it too many times to think otherwise.
<br><br>
Our staffers are the ones who rose to the occasion when we were understaffed and struggling to make deadline in fall quarter. They were the ones who rolled up their sleeves this year when there were inserts and special projects to assemble. And they were the ones who rolled up their pant legs and reported when this campus was underwater in late July. They say there&apos;s supposed to be a transition period in taking over The Bruin, but our incoming editor in chief and managing editor have already gotten their feet wet.
<br><br>
They&apos;re the ones who put up with my horrible puns, like the one you just read.
<br><br>
They&apos;re the ones who made the Daily Bruin a home for me. It&apos;s a home I leave with a receding hairline and a few wrinkles, but with memories that make them worth it.
<br><br>
I started my journey at UCLA as a nervous women&apos;s water polo reporter. I end it nervous that I&apos;ll forget some of the incredible places this paper has allowed me to go.
<br><br>
Places like Myles Jack&apos;s living room, where Tim Bradbury and I finished up an interview and then drove into Seattle excitedly singing Katy Perry. I&apos;m sorry, Tim.
<br><br>
Places like Memphis&apos; FedExForum, where Kevin Bowman and I took barbecue recommendations from Tony Parker before covering the Sweet 16. You&apos;re right, Tony, Central was delicious.
<br><br>
Places like the press box of Memorial Stadium, where I watched Nebraska&apos;s student section &ndash; the Big Red faithful &ndash; release blue and gold balloons to remember Nick Pasquale. I still get chills thinking about that.
<br><br>
This year, I&apos;ve seen things from a different perspective, hunched over my desk in Kerckhoff 118 in the rickety wooden editor&apos;s chair.
<br><br>
It&apos;s a view I&apos;ve grown fond of, but really, Sam Hoff, I&apos;d consider replacing that chair.
<br><br>
I often tell people I don&apos;t think I will have a job more interesting than this one. That&apos;s not meant to be sad, but more the result of a fast-paced and ever-changing college newsroom environment.
<br><br>
That feeling is a reflection of the people I&apos;ve met and worked with. It&apos;s a reflection of the people who have shared their stories within our pages and especially the people who have emailed, called and visited to voice their opinions on our work, often to disagree.
<br><br>
I have so appreciated the opportunity to spend a year at the helm of this newsroom and four in UCLA&apos;s newsstands.
<br><br>
The Daily Bruin has launched me over the wall. Now I&apos;m going, going, gone.

Not me.
<br><br>
I was already living on my own in an apartment in San Diego &ndash; my 13th home &ndash; three days after graduating high school. Growing up in a Marine Corps family, moving became a normal part of my life.
<br><br>
The next four years at UCLA were no different. I lived in two dorm rooms, two apartments, two houses and a few hotel rooms along the way.
<br><br>
But during all that time of moving around, one place always felt like a real home: the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
In the windowless office filled with yellowing newspapers, I learned home is not a house or even a place.
<br><br>
It&apos;s a feeling.
<br><br>
Home is the support I feel when I walk into a room and see my family &ndash; the people who embrace me even on my worst days.
<br><br>
And let me tell you &ndash; there were some bad days. Stories fell through, and people threatened to sue. But no matter what, my Daily Bruin family was always there to help me through it.
<br><br>
Home is the pride I feel when I see people I care about succeeding.
<br><br>
As an editor, that was seeing my writers go from hesitant interns to confident reporters who wrote stories they were proud of. It was watching my closest friends create incredible journalism. The Daily Bruin staff is full of people who impress me and inspire me every day.
<br><br>
Home is coming into the office to write stories and knowing, more than anything else, this is what I should be doing.
<br><br>
Just weeks after starting at The Bruin, I no longer felt like the &quot;new kid,&quot; which was a feeling I carried for most of my life. I found my best friends at The Bruin. I found my passion in journalism. I found my sense of self.

                    <p>I fell in love with photography in a high school darkroom.
<br><br>
More specifically, I fell in love with the process. The flow of dipping prints from one chemical into another to the constant beat of a ticking clock was mesmerizing.
<br><br>
For a high school senior with few real outlets for creativity, I found myself captivated by the satisfaction of creating art with my hands.
<br><br>
So when I came to UCLA &ndash; thousands of miles from home v to study computer science, I immediately searched for a place to practice my photography. It took two quarters of bouncing between clubs before I found myself in a photojournalism internship at the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
I quickly threw myself into my work, seeking the same satisfaction I found in the darkroom. The Bruin of course no longer uses film photography, and I instead started practicing digital photography.
<br><br>
The switch was almost instantaneous, and I quickly fell for photojournalism and the job of capturing moments and people. Though inexperienced and mostly a nuisance to my editors, I took shoot after shoot to hone my skills.
<br><br>
Along the way, I avoided my computer science studies because they didn’t inspire the same passion that photojournalism did.
<br><br>
It didn’t help that every tough moment in my college career &ndash; from ending a long-term relationship to struggling with school &ndash; was followed by more time spent at The Bruin.
<br><br>
By my third year, I was hopelessly in love with journalism. I trained in multiple sections to produce different types of journalistic content. I stuck my head in meetings that I had nothing to do with to hear and contribute ideas.
<br><br>
And as years passed and life after college came closer, I felt torn between computer science and journalism.
<br><br>
But then &ndash; this year, in fact &ndash; things worked out.
<br><br>
I directed my love for journalism toward a specific focus: online journalism. And even though I am not pursuing online journalism right after college, practicing it has helped me find satisfaction in creating with code.
<br><br>
The Bruin once had a darkroom in the center of the office, but it was replaced with a computer server room during the transition into the digital age.

It seems that now, a decade and a half later, my mind has transitioned the same way.

                        I&apos;ve never liked reading newspapers.
<br><br>
I find them uncomfortably large when opened, and I&apos;ve never been able to turn their pages without them trying to fall all over the place.
<br><br>
They&apos;re supposed to be effective conduits of important information but have the navigation scheme of a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; novel. I start at the beginning, get cut off, have to jump to the middle of a random page to get to an ending and then I have to start over.
<br><br>
It&apos;s frustrating because I like information. I like good writing and good journalism. I like knowing what&apos;s going on in the world around me. The revenue from the print product still pays the bills, but it has always seemed to me a poor medium for what it&apos;ss supposed to do.
<br><br>
So I joined the Daily Bruin&apos;s Online department as a programmer to help improve its website. On the internet, I like the newspaper a lot better. The content fits comfortably on a phone screen, the navigation is coherent and articles can be searched for and saved without the physical overhead. Compelling stories can be enhanced with or told exclusively through audio and video.
<br><br>
However, I&apos;ve since learned there&apos;s something valuable about having to make something people can touch, though the benefit isn&apos;t necessarily for the readers. The pressure to fill a physical space that would otherwise be conspicuously blank creates a sense of urgency and purpose. Writers, editors, graphic designers, page designers, photographers, illustrators and copy editors have to work together to ship a product on a daily basis. It creates a stupid amount of stress for everyone involved. But having to work parallel to those kinds of pressures gives us as programmers content to work with and projects with deadlines.
<br><br>
As a result, the Daily Bruin&apos;s Online department has become an unlikely incubator and home for talented developers. We&apos;ve had people on our staff become interns at Facebook, Yahoo and Tumblr. This summer we have contributors that will be working at Microsoft, Adobe, Hulu, Disney, Bloomberg, Ernst and Young and startups in New York. We have graduating seniors that will be taking full time jobs at Google, Amazon, JPMorgan and IBM.
<br><br>
Most impressive of all to me is the young woman who came in here with no programming experience at all, and after less than a year she has an internship that will lead to a full-time web developer position after she graduates this spring.
<br><br>
The people here are talented and hardworking and would have been successful anywhere, so I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to work with them. It has been a rewarding experience to see people learn, collaborate and grow as they create visually stunning pages and cool interactive features. I&apos;m excited to see what the people here do next.
<br><br>
So while the Daily Bruin produces a physical paper that I find outmoded, it produces people that I find remarkable.

                    <div class="author">Kristen Taketa</div>
                    <div class="bio">Taketa was managing editor from 2014-2015, an assistant News editor from 2013-2014 and a News writer from 2012-2013.</div>

                    <p>I never believed I was meant to be a journalist.
<br><br>
I am 5 feet 2 inches tall and hardly have a commanding figure. I spent 12 years in Catholic school and was often taught to be kind but somewhat deferential to others. It wasn&apos;t easy for the 17-year-old, shy and awkward girl I was &ndash; the girl who abhorred public speaking, the girl who was too shy to dress up unless forced to do so &ndash; to become a journalist, somebody who cannot be limited by comfort zones or hesitations.
<br><br>
But the further I advance in this career, the more hours I spend reading the news or walking among passersby in the streets of Los Angeles, the more I know I have to be one.
<br><br>
I tell myself I must tell the stories of others because I am not confident in my own; even writing this column makes me uneasy, because I do not trust my own experiences are worthy of being told. It is because there&apos;ss always someone out there who has lived more fully, someone who has taken the mundane and most tragic parts of human life and endured them with grace and unassuming resilience.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve met some of them in the stories I&apos;ve written &ndash; from a veteran with a wife and five children who came back to finish his UCLA degree after almost three decades, to a mother who struggled with how to teach her 6-year-old daughter about cancer and what it was doing to her small body and blond hair.
<br><br>
But I also see many of them just walking around the city or near UCLA &ndash; like the people who drive the bus in the morning, or the people who prepare our food or the people with cardboard signs on Third Street Promenade who watch shoppers with sunglasses and large bags pass them by.
<br><br>
From time to time, try asking yourself the questions a journalist would ask. Where are they from? How did they get here? What can they teach you?
<br><br>
Do we ask ourselves these questions enough in the midst of our everyday routines, when we return home from work in the evening or before we go out on a Thursday night? Do we try hard enough to find the answers?
<br><br>
Our job as journalists is to make sure such people with stories worth telling do not pass through history unnoticed. I cannot walk in their shoes just yet, but for now, this job will do.

                    <div class="small-9 medium-9 large-8 columns">
                    <p>I recently joined a group of Daily Bruin staffers on a 3 a.m. trek to the outskirts of Los Angeles County to see our paper get printed. 
<br><br>
It felt like stepping back in time. It was also deafeningly loud and had a lingering, unidentifiable stench &ndash; but that&apos;s besides the point.
<br><br>
Ancient machines heaved blank sheets through colored plates and rotating gears to churn out our beloved paper. For the moment, we got to pretend we were in the golden era of newspapers &ndash; a time when people relied on the printed page rather than their computer screens.
<br><br>
Working at The Bruin is also a bit like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by archives of pictures, stories and columns that document not just the history of UCLA, but the paper itself. Inside jokes taped to the walls years ago and later forgotten. Clippings from old stories that someone was once proud of. A quote by an editor from generations past who no one has met, but everyone knows.
<br><br>
Like the rest of that golden newspaper era, The Bruin I know will soon fade into history.
<br><br>
My class graduates straddling the line between that old world of newsprint on our hands and the new world of online innovation. It is an exciting time with new and better-smelling possibilities.
<br><br>
For now, though, it is comforting to get lost in yesterday (I majored in history, so a penchant for nostalgia comes with the territory).
<br><br>
As I write this column, with commencement tickets on the table and my graduation gown hanging on the wall, I find myself clinging to the past more than ever.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to football games and midnight yells.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to the rooftop sunsets and tunneling adventures.
<br><br>
I&apos;m clinging to the strangers I found in my hall freshman year who now are my family.
<br><br>
But most of all, I&apos;m clinging to the Daily Bruin.
<br><br>
The future of journalism is murky. And, like many graduates, so is mine. For the first time in my life, I don&apos;t know the next step.
<br><br>
I do know that no matter what happens next, I will never really let go.
